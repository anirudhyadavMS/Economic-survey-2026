URBANISATION: MAKING 
INDIA’S CITIES WORK FOR ITS 
CITIZENS
India’s cities shape how millions of people live, work, travel, and earn their 
livelihoods every day. They are engines of growth, magnets for talent, and 
crucibles of innovation. At the same time, they are sites of daily strain: long 
commutes, uneven services, and shared spaces that often fall short of collective 
expectations. This chapter argues that India’s urban story is therefore neither 
one of decline nor adequacy, but of unfinished promise. 
The central idea is simple: cities are not merely habitats; they are a form of 
critical economic infrastructure. Density and proximity power productivity, 
deepen labour markets, and enable learning. Yet the same forces that create 
dynamism also generate congestion, environmental stress, and institutional 
complexity. India is already deeply urban in economic terms, with the majority 
of its national output generated in cities and in urban areas. The task now is to 
make that urbanisation work better for citizens in tangible and intangible ways.
Many urban pressures stem from persistent supply-side constraints in land, 
housing and mobility. Restricted density, unclear titles and limited land recycling 
constrain affordable housing, while transport systems remain overly reliant 
on private vehicles. Core services such as sanitation, waste, and water services 
have expanded markedly but must now evolve from expansion to reliability, 
circularity and efficiency. However, beneath these sectoral stresses lies a deeper 
institutional issue: fragmented metropolitan governance and limited fiscal 
autonomy for cities – to plan, finance and deliver at scale. 
Beyond infrastructure, there is a need to improve the intangible foundations 
of urban life, such as civic norms, shared responsibility, and respect for public 
spaces. As Elinor Ostrom's work on the commons reminds us, shared spaces and 
services depend as much on norms, trust, and collective behaviour as on formal 
rules. Similarly, Indian economic thought echoes this insight:D. R. Gadgil argued 
that development outcomes are ultimately shaped by institutions and social 
organisation, not investment alone. The quality of urban experience depends 
as much on collective behaviour as on budgets and bridges. Strengthening civic 
consciousness, alongside better institutions, is essential to creating cities that 
feel not only efficient but also welcoming.

Across all these themes runs a common optimism: India’s cities can work better 
for their citizens. If planning, finance, and governance align around people-
centric outcomes, India’s cities can move from managing growth to truly 
benefiting from it, turning urbanisation into a visible source of opportunity, 
well-being and everyday ease for citizens.  
INTRODUCTION
15.1.		 Throughout history, economic and social progress have depended on people 
clustering in settlements. From early river civilisations and market towns to modern 
metros, humans have grouped together to benefit from proximity. These agglomerations 
arose not just as homes, but also as responses to economic needs, such as exchanging 
goods, coordinating production, sharing resources, and transmitting knowledge. 
This reduced interaction costs, fostered specialisation, and supported infrastructure 
development impossible in dispersed areas. Over time, settlements became centres of 
economic activity, innovation, and power, making spatial agglomeration a key aspect of 
human progress.
15.2.		 These agglomerations, over time, assume the role of a ‘city’ when they cross three 
thresholds simultaneously: 1) Demographic scale and density sufficient for sustenance 
of multiple non-agrarian livelihoods 2) Economic diversification in terms of presence of 
multiple avenues of non-agrarian livelihoods, and 3) Institutional recognition through 
presence of an urban local body, statutory boundary, or formal planning authority.  In 
India, urban agglomerations of different population sizes are defined as Statutory and 
Census Towns; and RBI1 classifies ‘cities’ as per population (Table XV.1)
Table XV.1: Classification of Cities with different population sizes

15.3.		 Agglomeration economies underpin the economic logic of urbanisation. The 
density emanating from people and firms settling in proximity becomes productive. 
Larger and denser cities enable more efficient matching between workers and jobs, 
accelerate learning through frequent interactions and knowledge spillovers, and allow 
for the sharing of infrastructure, services, and specialised inputs. These mechanisms 
translate density into higher productivity, greater firm dynamism, and stronger

innovation outcomes. Globally, and increasingly in India, the most productive sectors—
modern services, advanced manufacturing, knowledge-intensive activities—are 
disproportionately urban, precisely because they rely on these agglomeration forces. 
A meta-analysis of agglomeration economies in developing economies by Grover, Lall, 
and Timmis (2021)2 finds that doubling city size typically boosts productivity by 12 per 
cent in India. Therefore, it becomes imperative that cities be viewed not only as habitats 
but as vital economic infrastructure. Edward Glaesar in his book “Triumph of the City” 
says, Cities are humanity’s greatest invention because they make us more productive, 
more innovative, and ultimately richer.
The Paradox 
15.4.		 India’s urban population has expanded rapidly in absolute terms, with large 
metropolitan regions such as Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad 
now ranking among the world’s largest urban agglomerations by population. However, 
population scale has not translated proportionately into urban productivity, liveability, 
or global economic influence.
15.5.		 In advanced and emerging economies alike, a small number of metropolitan 
regions function as nodes in global production networks, financial systems, logistics 
chains, and knowledge ecosystems. Despite India’s economic scale today, its cities 
struggle to perform this role at the level of established global cities such as New York 
City, London, Shanghai, or Singapore.

15.6.		 International evidence suggests that urbanisation delivers growth dividends 
when cities are able to internalise agglomeration economies through efficient labour 
markets, infrastructure networks, and institutional coordination. In India, urban 
infrastructure investment in domains such as transport, housing, water, sanitation, 
or governance capacity has lagged behind the economic importance of cities. This 
has led to high population density manifesting as congestion, informalisation, and 
infrastructure stress, diluting potential productivity gains. This divergence raises an 
important structural question: why has India’s economic growth not translated into 
globally competitive cities, and what constraints prevent Indian cities from fully 
realising agglomeration-led growth?
15.7.		 This chapter proceeds from that premise. It positions cities not as problems 
to be managed or welfare burdens to be contained, but as economic assets that 
require deliberate investment and strategic planning. Recognising cities as economic 
infrastructure is a necessary first step toward aligning public policy, fiscal priorities, 
and planning frameworks with India’s development trajectory.
Trends in India’s urbanisation
15.8.	 The Census of India requires settlements to be marked by three conditions to 
be classified as urban: (a) The settlement population must be greater than 5,000; (b) 
75 per cent of male employment should be non-agricultural; (c) Minimum population 
density of 400 persons/square kilometre. The definition also adds those towns that 
have been administratively classified as statutory towns3. India’s urbanisation pattern 
is strongly shaped by its largest cities. Over 70 per cent of the urban population resided 
in Class I cities (those with more than one lakh people) in 2011, and the country’s 52 
metropolitan cities (more than 10 lakh population) alone accounted for 42.3 per cent of 
all urban residents. Higher population growth rates in these large agglomerations have 
driven rapid metropolitan expansion, highlighting India’s distinctly top-heavy urban 
system4. 
15.9.		 According to the census definition, India’s urbanisation has been slowing – the 
proportion of the population living in urban areas in India, a lower-middle-income 
country (LMIC) as defined by the World Bank, is marginally lower than the average in 
LMICs and low-income countries (LICs). Mohan (2025)5 hypothesises that this could 
be due to the “ruralisation of industry” whereby rural areas account for a significant 
chunk of manufacturing output. This is compared to the experiences of China, East 
Asia, and Southeast Asia, where urban areas emerged as the major contributors to 
manufacturing, thereby driving rural-urban migration.

municipal corporations, municipalities, cantonment boards, or notified town area committees.

15.10.	 While the Census of India definition of an urban area facilitates appropriate 
comparisons over the years, there is a growing acknowledgement of the importance 
of measuring urbanisation using data on mobility, labour markets, density, built-up 
areas, and night-time light data. The Janagraha Foundation’s Annual Survey of India’s 
City Systems (ASICS) 2023 report suggests that India may be far more urban than the 
Census indicates. This is also supported by the estimates of urbanisation presented 
in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ (UNDESA) World 
Urbanisation Prospects 2025 revision using their Degree of Urbanisation (DEGURBA) 
methodology6. Based on satellite data from the Global Human Settlements Layer 
(GHSL) of the Group on Earth Observations at the European Commission, India was 
63 per cent urban in 2015, which is nearly double the urbanisation rate reported in the 
2011 Census.

15.11.	  Night-time lights (NTL) data present a visually striking method to understand 
the scope and extent of urbanisation. NTL data acquired by satellites has become 
one of the key indicators for analysing wide-range man-made activities. It serves as a 
dependable marker for urbanisation, population density and economic activity. Earth 
Observation data from Bhuvan, the geo-sensing platform of the National Remote Sensing 
Centre (NRSC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), is utilised to present the 
increases in key urban centres. Night light radiance is expressed in nanowatts per 
square centimetre per steradian (nW/cm²/sr) – broadly indicating the amount of light 
energy detected over a specific area and angle.

15.12.	  The images above illustrate the changes in NTL across eight major urban centres 
between 2012 and 2023. Red shading indicates major urban zones, commercial districts, 
and densely populated regions with considerable artificial lighting. Pale yellow marks 
semi-urban or peri-urban areas, while grey indicates small villages and less-populated 
suburban zones. Black areas represent rural regions with minimal artificial lighting.  It 
is observed that older cities, such as Mumbai and Bangalore, exhibit smaller increases 
in highly dense regions but have expanded notably into semi-urban or peri-urban 
zones. Cities such as Pune and Hyderabad have experienced substantial growth in their 
densely populated areas, while also undergoing significant expansion into peri-urban 
regions. These observations are substantiated by the results of the Ministry of Housing 
and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) analysis on the dynamics of periphery-core growth. The 
periphery-to-core growth ratios provide deeper insights into how spatial expansion is 
distributed within metropolitan regions. In 16 cities7, the ratio exceeds one, indicating 
that peripheral areas have consistently grown faster than the urban core between 
2000 and 2020. This confirms that India’s metropolitan expansion is overwhelmingly 
outward, with new growth increasingly concentrated in urban fringes beyond municipal 
boundaries. Debroy & Misra (2024)8  confirm this using novel high-frequency data. They 
find that across Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, and Kolkata, urban growth is closely aligned 
with transport corridors and is accompanied by rapid conversion of agricultural land 
to non-agricultural uses. These patterns highlight the growing importance of suburban 
regions in shaping urban labour markets, housing demand, and infrastructure needs.
15.13.	 India’s urban development will increasingly rely on planning approaches that 
recognise the growing scale and diversity of metropolitan regions. Strengthening 
spatial monitoring systems, adopting harmonised classification tools and integrating 
core–periphery analyses can support data-driven decision-making. As peri-urban belts

emerge as important nodes of residential, industrial, and logistics activity, planning 
frameworks will benefit from a broader metropolitan and regional perspective, especially 
in areas where economic and mobility linkages extend beyond statutory boundaries. 
Box XV.1: Rethinking urbanisation in India using spatial 
classification: evidence from Kerala9  
Building on the evidence of extensive peripheral growth and the limitations of administrative 
boundaries in capturing emerging settlement patterns, this section adopts a spatially 
harmonised approach to measuring urbanisation. Kerala offers a compelling case to 
demonstrate how such methods can reveal the true extent and morphology of urban growth. 
Spatial Approach and Methodological Framework
Kerala provides an illustrative case, particularly in contexts where settlement patterns are 
highly dispersed and administrative boundaries do not fully capture the extent of built-
up and economically integrated areas. To examine these dynamics, this section employs 
the Global Human Settlement – Degree of Urbanisation (GHS-SMOD/DEGURBA) 
classification for 2010, 2020, and 2025, a globally standardised methodology that enables 
consistent identification of rural and urban settlements on a fine spatial scale (Dijkstra 
et al., 2021). The analysis begins by mapping population-density grids in Kerala at the 1 
sq.km level and classifying them into Urban Centres (≥1,500 persons/km² & ≥50,000 
people), Urban Clusters (≥300 persons/km² & ≥5,000 people), and Rural Areas based on 
harmonised criteria. These classifications are then overlaid on 1,555 spatial units (villages, 
census towns, statutory towns), using the census boundary dataset, to assess the extent to 
which individual units meet thresholds for being designated as New Urban Centres or New 
Urbanising Settlements. A rule-based approach is used in which a settlement is categorised 
as a New Urban Centre if at least 70 per cent of its area falls within Urban Centre grids, and 
as a New Urbanising Settlement if 70 per cent or more of its area lies within Urban Cluster 
grids or a combination of Urban Centre and Urban Cluster grids.
A crucial aspect of the analysis is accounting for Kerala's institutional changes since the 
2011 Census, including the creation of 34 new urban local bodies, expansion of municipal 
boundaries, and consolidation of census towns and villages into statutory towns. Including 
these updates ensures that spatial classification accurately reflects current governance 
and identifies settlements with urban traits that extend beyond statutory limits. This 
combined approach offers a comprehensive view of Kerala’s evolving urban landscape and 
complements existing measures. 
Spatial Transformation of Kerala’s Settlement Structure (2010–2025) 
The spatial classification reveals that Kerala’s settlement structure has undergone significant 
changes over the last decade, highlighting the expansion of urban areas. In 2010, the 
DEGURBA framework identified 420 settlements, including 29 New Urban Centres and 391 
New Urbanising Settlements, which collectively housed approximately 8.2 million people. 
When combined with statutory towns, Kerala’s urban population increased from 47.7 per 
cent (2011 Census) to around 72.2 per cent, revealing many functionally urban areas.

596
By 2020, the number of spatially identified urban-type settlements increases to 484, including 
48 New Urban Centres and 436 New Urbanising Settlements, accommodating around 9.02 
million people. Considering the creation of 34 new urban local bodies, expansion of existing 
municipal boundaries, and several post-2011 reclassifications, Kerala’s updated statutory 
urbanisation level is revised at 53.81 per cent. When the spatially identified settlements 
are added, the estimated urbanisation increases to about 80.8 per cent, reflecting the 
widespread expansion of built-up and integration of economic areas beyond traditional 
municipal limits.
Estimates for 2025 indicate a further increase to 526 spatially identified urban-type 
settlements—65 New Urban Centres and 461 New Urbanising Settlements—housing 
approximately 9.63 million people. This raises the urbanisation estimate to 82.6 per cent, a 
level broadly aligned with long-term demographic projections for the state. Complementary 
built-up analysis across major cities reinforces these findings. Between 2010 and 2025, the 
built-up area expanded by 11.4 per cent in Kochi, 17.6 per cent in Thiruvananthapuram, 17.5 
per cent in Kannur, and 19.6 per cent in Thrissur. Periphery-to-core growth ratios reached 
as high as 5.9 in Kannur and 5.2 in Kochi, indicating that much of the spatial expansion is 
occurring in peripheral areas even after recent adjustments to municipal boundaries.

Kerala’s urbanisation features numerous dispersed settlements with urban functions, 
many outside town boundaries. Spatial analysis offers insight into growth beyond 
administrative boundaries, revealing evolving settlement patterns and extensive 
built-up, integrated areas. 
Spatial insights from Kerala’s urban transition
i.	
Recognising functionally urban settlements: The spatial analysis reveals many 

Urbanisation
597
597
      settlements in Kerala outside municipal limits that show urban traits. These Urban  Centres 
and Urbanising Settlements serve large populations and play key economic and social 
roles. This indicates dispersed urban growth, forming a ribbon-like urban conurbation.
ii.	 Strengthening peri-urban and regional planning approaches: Urban expansion 
in Kerala is now centred in peri-urban and corridor areas outside city boundaries. 
This pattern requires planning approaches that extend beyond city limits and manage 
growth at a regional scale. Tools such as GIS-based master plans, multimodal mobility 
frameworks, and designated Special Planning Zones can help guide development in 
these fast-transforming areas and ensure coordinated, sustainable expansion. 
iii.	 Supporting strategic regional nodes: The distribution of emerging urban 
settlements reveals several regional growth nodes across Kerala, including medium-
sized towns and peri-urban clusters like Ernakulam–Aluva–Kakkanad, Malappuram–
Perinthalmanna corridor, and parts of Thrissur. These serve as key components of the 
urban system, highlighting the growing importance of secondary and intermediate 
settlements in the evolving landscape. 
iv.	 Governance systems and boundary considerations: The expansion of built-up 
areas and the growth of Census Towns and transitional settlements illustrate the evolving 
relationship between statutory boundaries and actual settlement patterns. These 
spatial changes highlight the dynamic interactions between the types of settlements, 
administrative structures, and functional urban areas. Strengthening the institutional 
capacity of new or expanded urban bodies remains relevant for understanding how 
governance systems adapt to these transitions. 
v.	 Financing transitional areas and enhancing spatial monitoring: Many 
transitional areas face challenges due to their position between rural and urban 
administrative systems. These areas often experience changing land use patterns and 
infrastructure pressures. Institutionalising spatial tools like DEGURBA as complementary 
monitoring instruments can enhance the ability to track settlement transitions, support 
evidence-based planning, and guide the interpretation of evolving urbanisation patterns. 
GOVERNANCE DEFICIT: WHEN CITIES LACK ECONOMIC 
AGENCY
15.14.	 One of the central structural constraints is the institutional design of Indian 
cities. Unlike global cities that operate with significant administrative and fiscal 
autonomy, Indian cities remain embedded within multi-layered governance structures. 
Urban functions are fragmented across: Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), Development 
Authorities, State line departments and Parastatal agencies
15.15.	 While ULBs play an important formal role, many key functions—such as land 
use, policing, utilities, and cadre management—continue to be exercised at the state 
level. This creates a governance architecture in which strategic coordination across 
transport, land, housing and economic development is shaped largely beyond the 
municipal tier. Mayoral leadership and municipal accountability, therefore, operate 
within a system where authority is shared across multiple levels.  

Economic Survey 2025-26
598
598
15.16.	 In India, there is an inherent contradiction in urban policy and expected 
outcomes. Cities are expected to deliver growth, productivity, and jobs, yet policy is 
designed to restrain density, fragment authority, and ration urban land. Indian urban 
policy often reverses this logic. The result is not chaotic cities, but rather cities that fail 
to achieve the expected outcomes due to interconnections and integration. Metro rail, 
flyovers, and expressways are built without parallel land-use reform, housing supply, 
or skill clustering. Transport systems are asked to compensate for planning failures 
rather than enable density. The result is capital-intensive infrastructure with sub-
optimal economic returns. Metro systems move people, but they do not always raise 
productivity because jobs, housing, and transport remain misaligned. Infrastructure 
without institutional reform is concrete without consequence.

15.17.	 Global cities invert this. Electoral, planning and financial accountability are 
mostly aligned. Mayors or city governments are directly elected, like in India, but 
are also empowered to make city-planning and financial decisions, control land-
use and transport planning through unified metropolitan plans, and command 
meaningful own-source revenues or predictable fiscal transfers. Hence, there is room 
for improvement in accountability. For e.g. in certain economically important cities in 
the United States, the Mayor’s Office oversees citywide planning, capital budgeting, 
and service delivery, funded by strong local taxation powers. Indian cities raise less 
than 0.6 per cent of GDP in own-source revenues, borrow negligibly, and depend 
overwhelmingly on intergovernmental transfers. The World Bank Report on ‘Financing 
Urban Infrastructure’ quotes (Kelly, 2020) to say that Urban property tax is the largest 

Urbanisation
599
599
OSR (Own Source Revenue) but remains minuscule relative to comparators, being only 
0.15 per cent of GDP in aggregate nationwide, compared to 0.3–0.6 per cent of GDP 
for low- and middle-income countries on average. For most large Indian cities, OSR 
covers only 30-40 per cent of total municipal expenditure, falling to below 20 per cent 
for smaller cities. Comparatively, OSR for OECD cities is roughly 2-4 per cent of GDP, 
with property tax alone ranging between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent, increasing to 3 per 
cent in some US cities. 
15.18.	 Despite their limited economic independence, cities contribute disproportionately 
to economic growth.  World Bank estimates that by 2036, India’s towns and cities will 
be home to 600 million people, or 40 per cent of the population, up from 31 per cent in 
2011, with urban areas contributing almost 70 per cent to GDP. Comparison10 of  GDP/
Population ratio of large cities in India, China, the US and Germany (2023) found that 
the top-10 cities account for only ~9 per cent of the population but nearly 28 per cent 
of GDP, a ratio of ~3×—far higher than the US (~1.5×), Germany (~1.5×), or China 
(~1.8×). Given their significant contribution, any infrastructure breakdown here would 
have disproportionate effects on national growth.
15.19.	 Hence, cities become economically central. However, they remain politically 
peripheral. Electoral, fiscal, and administrative responsibilities remain distributed 
across multiple tiers of government. This institutional structure can constrain the ability 
of city governments to mobilise revenues, coordinate planning, and take long-term 
investment decisions at the metropolitan scale. This limits political ownership of urban 
outcomes and reduces incentives for deep institutional reform. The result is a model 
in which cities function primarily as implementation units rather than autonomous 
economic actors. Global cities compete; Indian cities comply. 
15.20.	There is a case made for aligning authority and accountability, because even 
as Indian cities are administered, global cities are governed. Administration disperses 
power to avoid blame. Governance concentrates it to enable action and accountability.
LAND, HOUSING, MOBILITY, AND SANITATION AND 
WASTE MANAGEMENT – THE BINDING CONSTRAINTS
Land as dead capital
15.21.	 In economic parlance, dead capital refers to assets that are unable to function as 
productive capital. These resources are unable to contribute to economic activity due to 
being constrained by regulatory, legal, or market inefficiencies. In many of our cities, 
land has effectively become dead capital due to a combination of restrictive land-use

regulations, title insecurity, and fragmented markets, as well as speculative incentives 
that lead to low land recycling. 
15.22.	Restrictive land-use regulations in the form of Development Control Regulations 
(DCR), such as low floor space index (FSI) or floor-area ratio (FAR), place a cap on the 
amount of built-up area per unit of land, constraining vertical development and forcing 
spatial expansion outward rather than upward. This distortion raises land values and 
creates artificial scarcity in core urban areas. Compared to global cities like New York 
and Hong Kong, India’s cities have relatively lower FSI, with exceptions for denser areas 
such as central business districts. When the FSI is low, settlements are incentivised to 
expand horizontally, driving up average land cost and increasing infrastructure delivery 
costs per unit of housing or commercial space. This limits housing supply and raises 
prices relative to incomes. 
15.23.	 Many state governments and urban bodies are addressing and modifying DCRs 
and granting additional FSI for a premium on a piecemeal basis. However, a holistic 
rethink will be required for meaningful change at scale. For example, the Chennai 
Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), in drafting its third master plan, is 
reportedly considering a higher FSI in key zones, mixed-use development, and phased 
upgrades to support compact and vertical growth across the city11. Urban bodies and 
state governments can leverage MoHUA’s resources, such as the guidance document 
on preparing transit-oriented development (TOD) plans12, in optimising city densities.

15.24.	Another reason why land remains unproductive is unclear land titles, compounded 
by fragmentation and opaque records. Secure, transferable property rights are essential 
for land to function as capital. They allow land to be used as collateral, traded in formal 
markets, and redeveloped efficiently. Land tenure and security encompass securing and 
transferring rights related to land and natural resources. This includes titling, resolving 
land disputes, land acquisition, and managing informal settlements. The central 
government has undertaken multiple initiatives to address these obstacles. Under 
the aegis of the Digital India Land Records Modernisation Programme (DILRMP), 
the government introduced the Unique Land Parcel Identification Number (ULPIN 
or Bhu-Aadhaar, as well as the National Generic Document Registration System 
(NGDRS). State governments have also introduced digital systems to address these 
issues. These include, inter alia, the Telangana government’s single digital platform, 
where the revenue, stamps, and registration departments are integrated with the Bhu 
Bharati portal13, and the Karnataka government’s transition towards issuing digital 
land records under its ambitious Bhu Suraksha scheme14.
15.25.	 It is important to note that while increasing FSI and FAR may unlock economic 
value in terms of more built-up area per unit of land, the consequent rise in density will 
result in unproductive outcomes if augmenting infrastructure is not in place. As some 
analysts note15, the focus on “de-congestion” can mislead planners into spreading cities 
outward rather than building infrastructure to support compact growth, even though 
successful global cities are dense by design and pair density with robust services. 
Amenities such as mass transit, water, and sanitation, among others, must be key factors 
in the decision-making process. In the absence of adequate amenities, a rise in density 
will result in traffic gridlocks, water shortages and overwhelmed sanitation systems.
Mobility
15.26.	Cities are complex, living entities with their own systems, identities, cultures, 
and challenges. Transportation functions as their bloodstream, spine, and muscles, 
facilitating the flow of people, goods, and ideas, establishing structure, and supporting 
productive activity. When transportation systems are inadequate, the city’s vitality 
diminishes—congestion, pollution, noise, and reduced productivity emerge as 
symptoms of decline.
15.27.	 There are several varying estimates of the loss in productivity across cities 
resulting from traffic congestion. A Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) report16 
on Delhi’s congestion troubles states that an unskilled worker stands to lose between 
₹7,200 - ₹19,600 per year due to congestion. Similarly, skilled and highly skilled workers

can lose as much as ₹8,300 - ₹23,800 and ₹9,000 - ₹25,900 a year, respectively. A 
working paper by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC)17 estimated the 
loss of productive hours due to the late arrivals caused by traffic congestion would be 
around 7.07 lakh hours in 2018 for Bengaluru city, translating to a monetary cost of 
around ₹11.7 billion. A 2018 report by Uber–BCG estimated that costs associated with 
traffic congestion in the four metros of Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata were 
USD 22 billion per year18. According to the TomTom Traffic Index 2024, commuters in 
Bengaluru, Mumbai, and New Delhi lost 117 hours, 103 hours, and 76 hours, respectively, 
per year due to rush-hour traffic in their respective city centres19. Despite the variation 
in estimates, it is evident that the costs of mobility issues are high and on the rise.
15.28.	Effective treatment begins with identifying the underlying issue—a growing 
dependence on private vehicles. The vital signs of our cities are poor because roads 
are used more as storage for vehicles rather than corridors for people. Streets become 
congested not because citizens are moving excessively, but because cars carry too few 
passengers. Our roads have been utilised as storage for low-occupancy vehicles instead 
of facilitating movement for people. This diagnosis leads to the guiding principle: 
design cities to prioritise the movement of people, not vehicles. As the National Urban 
Transport Policy (2014) emphasises in its vision, we must “recognise that people 
occupy centre stage in our cities, and all plans should aim for their common benefit and 
well-being.” Solving for moving the most people requires prioritising modes with the 
greatest carrying capacity, across short and long distances.

15.29.	Operationally, this principle requires high-capacity public transport as the 
backbone; safe, reliable first and last-mile access through walking, cycling, and shared 
feeders; and demand-based parking and transit-oriented development to reallocate 
scarce urban space from storage to movement. Where these conditions hold, private 
vehicles revert to an option, not a compulsion. It should be possible, safe, comfortable 
and desirable for any citizen to get around the city in a reasonable timeframe without 
needing a private vehicle. While private vehicles have their advantages, the problem 
arises when they become a necessity rather than one choice among several other viable 
options. A lack of viable alternatives to private vehicle use leads to congestion and its 
resulting ills, as citizens compete for limited road space using geometrically inefficient 
transport modes.
15.30.	India has materially expanded mass rapid transit over the last decade. As of 
2025, ~1,036 km of Metro/RRTS are operational across around 24 cities, with further 
corridors under construction.20 The first Delhi–Ghaziabad–Meerut Namo Bharat 
RRTS corridor has ~55 km in service and is progressing towards full commissioning 
of around 82 km through phased openings and multimodal integration at hubs such 
as Anand Vihar. Box XV.2 explores the accomplishments of the RRTS. These systems 
are being delivered under the Metro Rail Policy (2017), which requires Comprehensive 
Mobility Plans, UMTA arrangements, and viability thresholds, and the National Transit-
Oriented Development (TOD) Policy (2017), which encourages compact, mixed-use 
growth, multimodal integration, and value-capture financing around stations.
Box XV.2: India’s first Namo Bharat Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) – 
A network of networks
The Delhi–Meerut Namo Bharat Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) represents a 
structural shift in India’s approach to regional urban mobility, positioning high-speed 
commuter rail as economic infrastructure rather than a transport add-on. Spanning 82 km 
and designed for speeds up to 180 kmph, the corridor reduces Delhi–Meerut travel times 
to under one hour, compared to 1.5–2 hours by road. The project’s financing structure—20 
per cent each from the Centre and participating states, and 60 per cent from ADB, AIIB 
and NDB—demonstrates a scalable template for leveraging public capital to crowd in 
development finance for urban-regional connectivity. 
The Namo Bharat RRTS has enabled NCR-wide integration across future corridors at Sarai 
Kale Khan, providing seamless interchange with the metro rail, Indian Railways, buses, and 
paratransit services. A notable innovation is the use of RRTS infrastructure for the Meerut 
Metro, resulting in a capital cost savings of approximately ₹6,300 crore. This integrated 
design enhances system viability, improves last-mile access, and highlights how shared 
infrastructure can increase returns on urban transport investments.

The corridor has been integrated into India’s first statutory implementation of Transit-
Oriented Development (TOD). Master plans for Meerut and Ghaziabad have notified TOD 
zones, with large greenfield townships—New Meerut (350 hectares) and Harnandipuram/
New Ghaziabad (541 hectares)—planned around RRTS stations. By enabling higher density, 
mixed-use, and employment decentralisation along the corridor, the project supports 
polycentric regional growth and relieves pressure on Delhi’s core, converting mobility 
investment into a spatial productivity dividend. 
The Namo Bharat RRTS also delivers substantial labour-market and inclusion benefits. 
Construction generated roughly 166 lakh mandays between 2019 and 2025, while operations 
are expected to support around 12 lakh mandays annually. Early accessibility estimates 
suggest large gains in jobs reachable within one hour—nearly 6.9–7.6 lakh for Meerut and 
about one lakh for Sarai Kale Khan—expanding effective labour markets across the region. 
Women’s participation has been deliberately mainstreamed, with over 35 per cent of train 
operators and station controllers drawn from nearby towns and villages, alongside broader 
community skill-building initiatives. 
The project illustrates how regional rail can advance India’s climate, digital, and institutional 
objectives simultaneously. Since partial operations began, an estimated 25 lakh vehicle 
trips have been avoided, offsetting around 69 lakh kg of CO₂, with a roadmap to source 
60 per cent of energy from renewables. In-house digital systems for project management, 
asset maintenance, and training have improved delivery efficiency and created replicable 
institutional capacity. Looking ahead, the identification of nearly 2,900 km of potential Namo 
Bharat RRTS corridors across regional clusters such as Bengaluru–Mysuru–Tumakuru–
Hosur, Chennai–Vellore–Villupuram–Chengalpattu and Hyderabad–Warangal, amongst 
others, suggests that, with a modest and predictable central outlay, this model could unlock 
high economic multipliers and support the emergence of India’s mega-regions as engines 
of growth. 
15.31.	 Complementing rail, the Government has launched PM e Bus Sewa to strengthen 
city bus operations with 10,000 e buses on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, 
backed by ₹20,000 crore central assistance and a Payment Security Mechanism (PSM) 
to assure operator cashflows. Official status notes21 for FY25 report 7,293 e-buses 
approved across 14 States and 4 UTs, ₹983.75 crore sanctioned for depot and behind-
the-meter power infrastructure, and ₹437.5 crore already disbursed.  
15.32.	 Despite these measures, gaps in mass transit services persist. City-level indicators 
reveal a capacity shortfall in buses. MoHUA recommends 40-60 buses per 1,00,000 
people. Yet, many cities have far fewer. Nationally, only about 47,650 buses serve its 
urban residents22. Nearly 61% of these are concentrated in just nine megacities. Due to 
the layout of urban roads, low bus availability combined with high private vehicle use 
reduces person throughput per lane kilometre, leading to congestion and longer door-
to-door travel times.

15.33.	 Door-to-door performance also depends on first–last mile access to stations. 
National consultations and field evidence indicate that, where safe and convenient 
first- and last–mile options are lacking, rail systems underperform against ridership 
projections, despite high in-vehicle speeds. Cities are increasingly responding by 
integrating feeder services and publishing open transit data; without this, travel time 
reliability and perceived convenience remain below potential.
15.34.	To further improve outcomes, the following measures may be useful:
a.	 Augment and digitise bus fleets: Scaling city bus fleets toward 40–60 
buses per lakh population can significantly increase person throughput on 
existing corridors at relatively low capital cost. Coupling fleet expansion with 
end-to-end digital systems improves reliability, reduces waiting times, and 
stabilises ridership and farebox revenues.  
b.	 Finance-first e-bus deployment: A Green Mobility Credit Facility—
combining interest subvention (to ~3–4 per cent), credit guarantees, and 
refinancing—can lower tariffs on gross cost contracts and improve project 
bankability. Such finance-led approaches reduce EMIs and accelerate e-bus 
adoption without relying on large upfront capital subsidies. 
c.	 Mainstream last-mile and shared mobility: Legalising and standardising 
shared feeders (share autos, e-rickshaws, minibuses, bike taxis) through simple 
permits, station pickup bays, and app integration can deliver rapid door-to-
door gains. Open, zero-commission platforms—linked to ONDC—enable 
transparent pricing, lower cancellations, and better access for women and off-
peak workers.
d.	 Operationalise Transit-oriented Development (TOD) and value 
capture around stations: Implementing the National TOD Policy via 500–
800 metre station influence zones, higher FAR, mixed-use zoning, and value-
capture tools can shorten trip lengths and cluster jobs near transit. Revenues 
from value capture can fund first–last mile connectivity and public-realm 
upgrades, strengthening network viability and compact growth.
e.	 Manage demand where geometry is most binding: Targeted congestion 
pricing in dense business districts (Box XV.3), combined with demand-based 
parking management, can reduce traffic, raise speeds, and cut emissions, 
as seen internationally. Recent reforms, such as the Chennai Metropolitan 
Area Parking Policy (2025)23 whereby private vehicle use is disincentivised, 
treats parking as valuable real estate, and prioritises walking, cycling, and 
public transport, shows that such demand-management tools are feasible 
complements to transit investment.

Box XV.3: International experiences and learnings from congestion pricing
Congestion pricing is a transportation demand-management strategy in which drivers are 
charged a fee for using roads during peak periods of congestion. Limited road space leads to 
slower speeds, higher delays, and increased externalities when overutilized. The core idea 
is to internalise the external costs of congestion, such as delays, pollution, and fuel waste, 
ensuring that those who use the most congested roads bear the actual cost of their travel.
This, in turn, aims to reduce the number of private vehicles during peak congestion time 
on the specific congested corridors, improve travel speeds, and encourage public transport, 
carpooling, off-peak travel. 
In a congestion pricing system, drivers are charged based on the following factors: location, 
time (peak vs off-peak), demand level (dynamic pricing), and vehicle type (cars, taxis, trucks, 
etc.) Payments are typically made via automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), RFID 
tags or GPS-based charging. Singapore and London stand out as examples of cities that have 
successfully implemented congestion pricing systems.
Singapore Electronic Road Pricing (ERP)
ERP is a dynamic, electronic, congestion-pricing system that automatically charges vehicles 
when they pass under a toll gantry during peak periods. It is specifically designed to manage 
and reduce traffic congestion, and decades of data from Singapore show that it works very 
effectively. It also works when observed speeds fall below the target thresholds, ERP charges 
are increased, and when speeds rise above them, charges are reduced. In the Previous ERP 
system, gantries were installed along key expressways, major arterial roads, and all entry 
points into the Central Business District (CBD). In contrast, ERP 2.0 extends congestion 
pricing beyond fixed gantry locations by enabling spatially dynamic, GPS-based ‘pay-as-
you-drive’ charging. 
The Area Licensing Scheme (ALS), introduced in 1975, reduced car entries into the CBD by 
about 45 per cent, and the subsequent implementation of ERP in 1998 achieved an additional 
10-15 per cent reduction in traffic on expressways and arterial roads during charged periods. 
The primary challenge was the public's resistance to monetising road usage, which many 
felt would unfairly favour the wealthy. The government addressed these equity concerns by 
pairing the pricing scheme with immediate "carrots," such as a comprehensive Park-and-
Ride network and improved bus services. By continuously fine-tuning operational hours 
and fees based on real-time data, authorities successfully framed the policy as a mechanism 
for optimising traffic flow rather than generating revenue. (Lim, 2014)24 (ITDP, 2016)25
London (Congestion Charge, 2003)
London’s road network is old, narrow, and cannot be widened, so managing demand, not 
supplying new road space, became essential. The London Congestion Charge is a cordon-

zone (90 per cent discount) 
The impact on traffic was sudden and dramatic. According to Transport for London’s own 
data (TfL,2003)26 traffic in the zone has decreased by 16 per cent (30 per cent for cars), while 
motorcycle, taxi, bus, and cycle traffic have increased. This translates into a 32 per cent 
reduction in congestion, measured in terms of delay per kilometre. Average traffic speeds 
have increased from 13 to 17 km/h. TfL (2003) estimates that the number of car trips into 
the zone has fallen by 150,000 per day, of which 10-20 per cent are displaced through trips, 
50-70 per cent have shifted to public transport, and 20-30 per cent went elsewhere other 
modes, travelled at other times, or chose alternative destinations (TfL, 2003).
The implementation of the congestion charge was met with accusations that it was "Just 
Another Tax," with critics arguing that it was regressive and harmful to the retail sector. 
To counter this, the government adopted a strategy of revenue hypothecation, legally ring-
fencing all proceeds for public transport investments. By starting with a modest £5 fee and 
visibly linking the charge to improved bus and underground services, the city demonstrated 
that the policy was a tool for service enhancement rather than a simple revenue grab. (Cani, 
2023)27  (Litman, 2005)28   
Urban cleanliness and waste management
15.35.	 Cleanliness and waste management in cities are critical aspects in India’s 
urbanisation journey. They have direct implications for public health, environmental 
sustainability, labour productivity and the overall quality of urban life. Over the past 
decade, the central government has undertaken one of the most ambitious and largest 
sanitation and waste management programmes globally under the Swachh Bharat 
Mission -Urban (SBM–U), complemented by investments under the Atal Mission for 
Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and AMRUT 2.0. These measures 
have yielded visible gains in sanitation outcomes, with the most notable being the 
elimination of open defecation across all cities.

15.36.	After the success of the first phase of SBM-U, SBM-U 2.0 was launched in October 
2021, with the policy focus shifting from improving access to achieving better outcomes. 
Progress under SBM-U 2.0 has been significant but uneven. Door-to-door collection of 
municipal solid waste (MSW), which was negligible in 2014–15, has expanded to 98 per 
cent of urban wards by 2025–26, supported by a fleet of over 2.5 lakh waste collection 
vehicles nationwide. Many large cities now use GPS-enabled vehicles and Integrated 
Command and Control Centres (ICCCs) to monitor collection routes and improve 
operational efficiency. At the national level, urban India generates approximately 1.6 
lakh tonnes of MSW per day, of which around 80 per cent is reported to be processed, 
compared to just 16 per cent in 2014–15. While this marks a substantial scaling up of 
waste management capacity, gaps in segregation quality, processing effectiveness, and 
enforcement persist at the local level. 
15.37.	 Despite these measures, many cities continue to struggle to move beyond basic 
compliance. Under the Garbage-Free City framework, cities are evaluated against 
progressively stringent benchmarks and assigned ratings. The ratings range from 1 
Star to 7-Star, linking door-to-door collection, segregation rates, waste processing, 
and legacy waste remediation. For instance, a 3-Star city must achieve at least 60 per 
cent segregation and 70 per cent processing, while a 7-Star city must reach 90 per cent 
segregation and processing, alongside near-complete remediation of legacy dumpsites. 
The assessment reveals that while there has been a rapid increase in the number of 
cities improving door-to-door collection, segregation at source, waste processing and 
dumpsite remediation lag behind. This suggests that urban cleanliness is no longer 
primarily an access issue, but rather an institutional and behavioural one.

Water (CEEW) (Khan, Mishra & Singh, 2025)29. The study presents a challenge–root 
cause–solution (CRS) matrix based on a comprehensive literature review of solid waste 
management (SWM) challenges, semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, and 
observations and learnings from field visits, identifying 26 challenges prevalent across 
the SWM supply chain. Over half of the 97 determined root causes are linked to the 
challenges stemming from people's mindset and understanding, organisational rules 
and management, and physical facilities and systems. 
15.39.	How can the public’s attitude towards waste management be changed? At the 
national level, MoHUA has identified Cleanliness Target Units (CTUs) as a key focus area 
under SBM-U 2.0. CTUs are difficult and dirty spots, including legacy waste dumpsites, 
that require urgent attention and transformation. From September 17, 2025, onwards, 
out of more than 16 lakh identified CTUs, 15.74 lakh CTUs have been transformed, with 
the participation of 7.75 crore citizens. While the figure is heartening, there needs to be 
a larger involvement of citizens in ensuring the cleanliness of our cities. In this context, 
Indore city serves as a good example of enhancing citizens’ participation.
15.40.	Indore, which ranked 25th in the 2016 round of the Swacch Survekshan 
Survey, has consistently ranked first since 2017. A key element in this turnaround 
was behavioural change at the mass level. The Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) 
took several steps to raise awareness among the population and promote segregation. 
Garbage collection vehicles were repurposed as moving platforms for the “Do Bin Har 
Din” campaign, reinforcing segregation practices. Communication efforts combined 
traditional outreach, such as nukkad nataks, wall paintings, and radio jingles, with an 
intensive use of social media, ensuring broad and repeated messaging. Schools involved 
students in cleanliness competitions and oath-taking during morning assemblies, 
instilling segregation norms at an early stage. A buy-in by city-level leadership was key 
to the transformation, with the mayor and ward councillors actively participating in 
campaigns. Municipal officials and elected representatives conducted joint roadshows 
to persuade households and establishments to comply.
15.41.	  Religious and local leaders were mobilised to leverage the social influence of 
faith and community networks. By linking cleanliness to values articulated in religious 
texts and participating in collective road-sweeping drives, they helped promote 
waste segregation as a shared civic responsibility. The IMC also engaged over 800 
self-help groups, comprising more than 8,000 women, both to spread awareness at 
the neighbourhood level and to staff material recovery facilities. This helped create 
livelihoods while also embedding a sense of community ownership. Incentives, such 
as awarding ‘zero-waste’ tags to markets and residential colonies that demonstrate

exemplary performance, encouraged peer competition. Penalties for littering and 
failure to segregate waste were strictly applied, supported by ward-level enforcement 
teams. The transformation of Indore city is evidence that instilling civic pride is one key 
lever in keeping our cities garbage-free. The role of citizens in building a Viksit Bharat 
by 2047 is outlined in Chapter XVI Part-2 (p.XX)
15.42.	Our cities need to leverage other best practices in waste management. A report by 
Niti Aayog30 captures some of these success stories from across the country, spanning 
domains such as material processing, biodegradable waste management, landfill 
management and technological innovation, among others. Additionally, local bodies 
should tailor their practices to manage city-specific challenges. (Khan, Mishra & Singh, 
2025)31 provide insights and case studies that can help municipal authorities adopt 
context-specific solutions to improve their waste management systems.
15.43.	Higher density of cities also places pressure on sewage and water supply systems. 
India is the world's third-largest generator of wastewater, producing an estimated 112 
billion litres per day of domestic and industrial effluent.32 Urban areas, alone, account 
for two-thirds of this volume as domestic used water, yet only 28 per cent is treated. 
Furthermore, cities recycle only 8 per cent of this treated wastewater for reuse. MoHUA 
estimates that currently, a reuse capacity of 1,992 million litres per day (MLD) is planned 
to be developed through sewerage projects. Box X.4 explores tapping the potential of 
sustainable water management through a circular water economy. 
Box XV.4: Turning India’s urban water stress into an opportunity 
using circular water economy33 
As freshwater scarcity in India’s cities intensifies, a model of ‘use and dispose’ will no longer 
suffice as our cities expand. The reuse of treated used water (TUW) for non-potable purposes 
is the next frontier for sustainable water management in India’s cities. It holds the power to 
reduce pressure on freshwater by diversifying water sources while creating large social and 
economic benefits. 
The economic potential of circular water systems is substantial. Reuse of TUW for non-
potable purposes, such as industrial cooling, construction and landscaping, could create a 
market of ₹2.4 – 3.2 lakh crore by 2047 and generate over 1 lakh employment opportunities34.

up enough freshwater to irrigate nine times the area of Delhi, highlighting the scale of 
opportunity locked in underused assets. 
However, most cities are not yet prepared to realise this potential. A CEEW assessment 
of 503 cities across 10 states finds that 82 per cent either do not reuse treated water or 
lack functioning treatment infrastructure. Outcomes remain constrained by fragmented 
planning, underinvestment in operations and maintenance, and weak reuse markets. Less 
than 27 per cent of households are connected to underground sewerage systems35 which 
limits both treatment volumes and the viability of reuse networks.
The government has supported the circular water economy. The ‘Jal hi Amrit’ initiative 
was launched under AMRUT 2.0 by MoHUA to incentivise States & UTs to manage the 
used water (sewage) treatment plants efficiently for ensuring recyclable, good-quality 
treated water, meeting environmental standards, on a sustained basis. So far, 860 Sewage 
Treatment Plants (STPs) with a total treatment capacity of 17,613 MLD in 402 cities across 
21 States and 4 UTs have been enrolled via the online platform, and their assessments have 
been submitted. 
To further improve the circular economy, a phased and outcome-oriented approach to 
developing a circular water economy can be considered. This would involve progressively 
increasing wastewater treatment capacity while simultaneously expanding reuse, rather 
than positioning treatment and reuse as sequential or separate objectives. Such an approach 
would enable infrastructure, demand, and regulatory capacity to develop in tandem. Given 
its institutional footprint, MoHUA is well-placed to anchor the effort, in partnership with the 
National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) and the National River Conservation Directorate 
(NRCD).
Financing and pricing arrangements will be key to ensuring the viability of a circular water 
economy. Calculations based on the most commonly used water treatment technologies 
suggest that to achieve 100 per cent sewage treatment, India would require capital 
investments of ₹1.5-2.3 lakh crore in technologies alone by 2047. Evidence from Indian 
cities indicates that long-term TUW offtake agreements, industrial buyers acting as anchors, 
hybrid annuity-style contracts, and municipal borrowing instruments can reduce revenue 
risk. Offering TUW to industrial and commercial units at discounted prices as compared to 
municipal freshwater can make the circular economy of used water financially attractive. 
A circular water economy is a coherent option for cities to turn wastewater from a waste 
issue into a useful urban resource. This approach can play a critical role in enhancing water 
security, easing the demand on freshwater sources, and supporting the long-term economic 
and environmental health of India’s urban expansion.

City Upgradation through Technology Adoption
15.44.	India’s urban systems have undergone sustained transformation through 
national initiatives to upgrade infrastructure and services. Through a rigorous focus on 
upgrading the quality of urban living, India launched schemes such as AMRUT, Smart 
Cities and Swachh Bharat, addressing different aspects of urban cities. 
15.45.	 The Smart Cities Mission (SCM), launched in June 2015, represents one of India’s 
most ambitious efforts to modernise urban infrastructure and improve the quality of 
life across a range of municipal services. The Mission was designed to transform 100 
select cities by strengthening core city infrastructure, promoting sustainable, citizen-
focused services, and leveraging technology to improve service delivery. It has pursued 
both area-based development through focused investments in selected urban districts 
and pan-city solutions that deploy digital tools for water supply management, mobility, 
waste processing, public safety, and real-time municipal governance. 
15.46.	As of 9 May 2025, cities under the SCM had completed a substantial majority of 
planned projects — including smart roads, cycle tracks, command and control centres, 
upgraded water and sewerage networks, and vibrant public spaces — with over 90 per 
cent of the roughly 8,067 projects completed and nearly ₹1.64 lakh crore invested36. 
However, the impact of the scheme is in the expansiveness of infrastructure retrofits 
and upgradation of services in most of the cities. Today, all 100 Smart Cities have 
operational Integrated Command and Control Centres (ICCCs) that use data and digital 
platforms to monitor urban services. Many cities have adopted technology for water 
(SCADA) and waste monitoring and management (garbage collection) systems. Most 
cities are either planning or have already brought in Intelligent Transport Management 
Systems to improve traffic flows within the dense city centres and technology has also 
been used to improve accessibility to basic education and health needs. 
INFORMALITY AS AN URBAN OUTCOME – FROM 
ERADICATION TO INTEGRATION
15.47.	 Informality is one of the most persistent and visible features of urbanisation 
in India. It manifests across housing, labour markets and enterprises and shapes how 
cities grow. Conventional urban policy has often treated informality as a transient 
phenomenon that arises from planning and governance failures, and as something that 
must be eliminated as cities modernise. However, decades of experience in India and 
globally indicate that informality is not an aberration but a structural outcome of rapid 
urbanisation under constrained formal systems. Slums, informal work and unregistered 
enterprises absorb excess labour, provide low-cost housing near jobs, and serve urban 
consumption and production needs that formal systems often fail to meet.

15.48.	Informal housing and slums play a key role in facilitating geographical proximity 
between labour and the place of work. In the absence of affordable housing, informal 
settlements often cluster near residential areas, industrial zones, or commercial 
establishments, providing access to employment and services that would otherwise 
be inaccessible to low-income migrants and workers. In India’s case, the shortage 
of affordable housing has increased sharply over the past decade. The report of the 
Technical Urban Group (TG-12) on Urban Housing Shortage 2012-1737 estimated that 
across urban India, there was a deficiency of 18.8 million houses in 2012, with 15 million 
households living in congested houses that required new housing. An ICRIER working 
paper (Roy & ML, 2020)38 estimates that this figure increased to 29 million in 2018 and 
finds that 99 per cent of the shortage was confined to low-income economic groups in 
2018. More recently, a Knight Frank - NAREDCO report39 projects that accounting for 
the existing shortage, the cumulative affordable housing demand in India by 2030 is 
estimated to be 30 million units. The report also finds that in India's top eight cities40, 
the supply of affordable housing (units costing less than ₹50 lakh) has declined from 
52.4 per cent in 2018 to 17 per cent by 2025. 
15.49.	In many Indian cities, affordable housing increasingly appears in peripheral 
areas due to lower land costs and easier access to large plots. Developers often move 
projects to the outskirts to keep prices attractive for low and middle-income buyers, as 
land acquisition is simpler. However, these areas typically lack sufficient infrastructure, 
including poor connectivity to employment centres, inadequate mass transit systems 
and civic amenities. Consequently, while these locations offer affordable housing, 
they often fall short in essential urban services required for sustainable living. This 
creates a dilemma: despite higher demand driven by affordability, the lack of proper 
infrastructure hampers their liveability and long-term appeal. 
15.50.	The government has undertaken multiple interventions to support affordable 
housing in urban areas. These include direct tax and GST benefits, inclusion in priority-
sector lending, which enables higher loan-to-value ratios and therefore smaller down 
payments, and provision of infrastructure status, amongst others. Under the two 
phases of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U), a total of 122.06 lakh 
houses have been sanctioned, of which 96.02 lakh have been completed/delivered to 
the beneficiaries across the country as on 24.11.2025. 
15.51.	 The informal labour market is just as key to the urban economy. A substantial 
share of urban employment, including self-employment and casual wage work, is

informal, absorbing migrants and low-skilled workers who lack opportunities in 
the formal sector. Informal jobs, ranging from construction and domestic work to 
vending and micro-services, offer flexibility and immediate income opportunities in an 
environment where formal jobs are relatively scarce. 
15.52.	 The mass departure of informal sanitation and domestic workers in Gurugram, 
Haryana, in mid-2025 vividly demonstrated the importance of the informal labour 
force to urban functioning. From across the city, it was documented41 how door-to-door 
garbage collection systems, operated largely by Bengali-speaking migrant workers and 
other informal staff, collapsed almost overnight as workers left the city amid fears of law 
enforcement actions. This left streets and gated communities littered with uncollected 
waste and rising public health risks. In many neighbourhoods, residents were forced 
to organise their own waste pickup or hire ad-hoc vehicles in the absence of trained 
crews. What had been routine, invisible work suddenly became impossible to overlook, 
underscoring how the smooth functioning of urban systems depends on a labour force 
that has no formal visibility yet is structurally indispensable. The disruption extended 
beyond sanitation, with domestic helpers, cooks and other informal service providers 
also leaving, leading households to scramble for alternatives and pay sharply higher 
rates. This episode illustrated that informal labour is not a peripheral or expendable 
sector but a foundational component of everyday urban life, whose absence can quickly 
translate into deterioration of services and elevated transaction costs for residents and 
local governments alike. Policymakers will do well to recognise the importance of the 
informal urban workforce and institutionally support their integration into the formal 
economy as well as the socio-economic urban fabric. 
15.53.	 In this context, the Pradhan Mantri Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM 
SVANidhi) has played a central role in restoring and strengthening the livelihoods 
of urban street vendors (SV). Apart from its emphasis on financial and digital 
transformation in urban SV, the scheme allows a Letter of Recommendation (LOR) 
to serve as valid identification for street vendors. This removes the need to rely on 
the lengthy and time-consuming surveys conducted by Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for 
vendor identification. A national digital vendor database now supports better planning 
and monitoring, while the scheme’s expansion to census towns, urban agglomerations 
and peri-urban areas ensures that vending communities across the broader urban region 
are included. With the objective of ensuring the hygiene and safety of street food, the 
FSSAI’s training of street food vendors as part of its capacity-building initiatives has led 
to improved working conditions, cleaner vending environments, and more dignified 
livelihoods.
15.54.	 Urban informality also extends to enterprises. Small, unregistered, and often 
41 	https://tinyurl.com/mrx2defb

615
615
home-based firms are embedded in urban supply chains and neighbourhood economies. 
They deliver essential goods and services at price points that formal firms often cannot 
match. Clusters of informal activity demonstrate significant economic output and 
employment intensity, despite operating outside formal regulatory frameworks. These 
enterprises are sensitive to high compliance costs, credit constraints, and land access 
barriers, highlighting how regulatory design affects urban economic structure.
15.55.	 Despite the importance of the informal sector to urban agglomerations, urban 
planning has frequently utilised traditional approaches to informal settlements; however, 
there is a growing shift toward more integrative and inclusive strategies.  From an economic 
perspective, such policies disrupt embedded capital, such as location and networks. 
Integration and upgradation of informal settlements and activities can be achieved 
through infrastructure provision and tenure security. Similarly, recognising informal 
workers and enterprises through simplified registration access to social protection and 
improved working conditions can raise productivity without compromising on flexibility. 
Informality is likely to remain a defining feature of our cities as India continues to urbanise 
further. Therefore, it becomes imperative to acknowledge this feature as a response to 
opportunity amid constraints. This will allow policymakers to design interventions that 
protect economic value while enabling a more inclusive and resilient urban transition.
CIVIC ORDER WITHOUT A SOCIAL CONTRACT: THE 
INVISIBLE FAULT LINE IN INDIAN CITIES
15.56.	 While shortcomings in urban experience are often attributed primarily to 
institutional capacity, the quality of everyday life is also shaped by the implicit social 
contract between citizens and urban institutions. The lived experience of Indian cities 
reflects not only gaps in infrastructure, but also the credibility of rules, the predictability 
of services, and the trust that underpins everyday cooperation. The difference between 
global and Indian cities is therefore less about engineering alone and more about 
whether institutions make cooperation rational and worthwhile.
15.57.	 Programmes such as Swachh Bharat sought to combine investments in 
sanitation infrastructure with large-scale behaviour change efforts42. Through sustained 
communication43, funding support and public participation, as well as cleanliness 
and public hygiene, were brought into mainstream policy discourse. Many states 
introduced bans on spitting44,45,  and littering, notified spot fines under Solid Waste 
Management by-laws, and strengthened environmental enforcement. Yet outcomes

remain uneven across cities and neighbourhoods. This is not primarily a problem of 
awareness or values, but of a fragile social contract. Where enforcement is inconsistent, 
service delivery unreliable, and penalties uncertain, compliance becomes contingent. 
When rules are applied unevenly, cooperation gives way to individual calculation. A 
striking contrast is visible between private and public spaces. Indian households invest 
heavily in maintaining their homes, while common spaces often receive far less care. 
This gap reflects the quality of the social contract. Where services are predictable and 
responsive, taxes and rules are seen as part of a shared system; where they are not, 
civic engagement weakens. People protect private property meticulously but hesitate to 
invest effort in common assets when there is limited confidence that collective restraint 
will be matched by collective benefit.
15.58.	This helps explain why large investments in urban infrastructure have not 
always translated into commensurate improvements in everyday urban experience. 
‘India Today’, in a unique country’s first civic survey, focused on ‘Gross Domestic 
Behaviour’46. The survey that explored India’s Civic Behaviour, Public Safety, Gender 
Attitudes, Diversity & Discrimination across 20 States and 2 UTs. The contradictory 
individual approach to morality and action is reflected in their analysis47: “Civic 
Behaviour (within the citizens) reflects a blend of contradictions, where individuals 
acknowledge the importance of public responsibility but often struggle to uphold those 
values when faced with personal gain or convenience.” The pattern is not one of simple 
neglect, but of a weak and uneven social contract: individuals are willing to cooperate 
when institutions are reliable, and withdraw when they are not. Civic order is therefore 
best understood as an institutional equilibrium rather than a cultural trait. 
15.59.	 Global cities institutionalise cooperation through design, certainty and credible 
enforcement. In Singapore, Tokyo, London and New York, clear rules, visible and 
proportionate penalties, high-quality municipal services, and legible urban design make 
compliance the rational choice. Over time, these systems reduce the need for constant 
exhortation because cooperation is embedded in everyday governance. Where local 
governments lack the operational capacity, regulatory tools and financial autonomy 
to deliver such predictability, the social contract weakens, and civic order depends 
disproportionately on campaigns and appeals, with limited and uneven results.

15.60.	In practice, strengthening enforcement is not only an operational challenge but 
also an institutional coordination problem. Urban local bodies often operate within 
fragmented authority structures, overlapping mandates, and limited administrative 
autonomy, which dilute accountability for rule implementation. Where responsibilities 
for street management, traffic, solid waste, and public health are dispersed across 
multiple agencies, consistent enforcement becomes difficult even when intent 
exists. Aligning mandates, clarifying ownership of outcomes, and insulating routine 
enforcement from ad-hoc intervention are therefore central to making rule certainty 
credible in everyday urban governance.
The new city: Creative, liveable, and interconnected
15.61.	 While fixing the aforementioned challenges, similar emphasis must be on the 
‘liveability’ of cities. The existing ‘Ease of Living Index’ by MoHUA, incorporates ease of 
living by measuring quality of life across the parameters of education, health, housing, 
water and sanitation, waste management, mobility, safety, and recreation. In 202548, 
the top 10 cities that topped Ease of Living are Pune, Navi Mumbai, Greater Mumbai, 
Tirupati, Chandigarh, Thane, Raipur, Indore, Vijaywada, and Bhopal. Notably, the cities 
on this list are largely newer or Tier-2 urban centres that have not yet been subjected to 
the intense population pressures experienced by Bengaluru, Delhi, or Mumbai over the 
past two decades. They remain ahead of the curve: urbanising, but not yet overwhelmed. 
Crucially, these cities already possess a foundational layer of infrastructure and viable

access to employment. Additionally, greenfield new cities such as Amaravati in Andhra 
Pradesh are coming up where an urban living space has to be designed from scratch. 
This combination creates a rare window of opportunity—where growth can still be 
shaped deliberately, rather than retrofitted after congestion, informality, and service 
deficits have set in.
15.62.	Indian cities will not become more liveable by fixing footpaths alone. Liveability 
emerges when cities are designed around people’s time, choices, and creativity, not just 
around infrastructure delivery. Globally, the most liveable cities are not necessarily the 
richest or newest; they are the ones that organise urban life to reduce friction, enable 
expression, and reward everyday participation. 
15.63.	The 
agglomerated 
densities 
of 
cities, 
if 
leveraging 
education 
and 
interconnectedness, grow faster than infrastructure-heavy ones. For example, Detroit 
in the US made massive investments in highways, factories, stadia, but ultimately 
did not keep up with the scale of investments in terms of economic output and yet 
the population collapsed. On the other hand, Boston in the US is infrastructure-light, 
with old housing styles, narrow lanes, and limited road and flyover construction, but 
it is swarming with educational institutions and a high concentration of universities. 
This has ultimately led to a shift towards modern and emerging sectors like education, 
finance, and biotech. In India, Bengaluru, arguably with insufficient physical 
infrastructure compared to Delhi or Mumbai, is almost the Silicon Valley of India, 
reaping the dividends of the agglomeration benefits of an entrepreneurial ecosystem. 
It grew primarily due to the concentration of engineering talent and institutions, and 
to wage growth and the creation of a modern city.  Glaeser in the Triumph of Cities 
shows that a 10 percentage point increase in the share of college graduates in a city is 
associated with ~0.5–1 percentage point higher annual population and income growth.
Planning, Governance and Financing
15.64.	The Government of India has taken a series of concerted efforts to address the 
financing requirements of city and urban development. The Urban Infrastructure 
Development Fund (UIDF), announced in the Union Budget 2023–24 with an initial 
outlay of ₹10,000 crore, was designed as a revolving fund routed through financial 
institutions to support Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities that lack creditworthiness but have 
viable infrastructure projects. Operated through the National Housing Bank, UIDF is 
intended to finance well-prepared projects and recover capital over time, pushing cities 
toward better project structuring, cost recovery, and credit discipline. Close on its heels 
is the ₹1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund (UCF), announced in the Union Budget 
2025-26, to build on this momentum by introducing competition and leverage into 
urban funding. The performance-linked urban financing mechanism will be used to 

Urbanisation
619
619
implement proposals for ‘Cities as Growth Hubs’ through Creative Redevelopment’ and 
enhancing water and Sanitationand financing bankable projects The fund is structured 
to co-finance up to 25 per cent of the cost of bankable urban projects, subject to the 
condition that at least 50 per cent of the cost is funded through bonds, bank loans, and 
PPPs. An allocation of  ₹10,000 crore in 2025-26 is expected to kick-start the fund 
and push Indian cities toward innovative, sustainable, and bankable infrastructure 
development rather than entitlement-based grants.
15.65.	 With such well-intentioned goals, it is essential that the regulatory and policy 
and implementation methodologies are also upgraded in sync with the objective of 
the economic planning. This requires a shift in thinking, from a scheme-compliance 
mindset to a balance-sheet and outcomes mindset.  First, cities need to build credible, 
multi-year capital investment plans that integrate land use, transport, utilities, and 
economic development, instead of proposing isolated projects Every million-plus city 
should be required to prepare a statutory 20-year City Spatial and Economic Plan, 
updated every five years, with three non-negotiable elements: (i) a transport network 
plan, (ii) a housing supply plan with annual unit targets, and (iii) a land-value capture 
framework linked to infrastructure corridors. Instead of discretionary case-by-case 
exemptions or incentives for FSI, planning permissions should shift to rule-based 
approvals using published FSI, height, and mixed-use norms related to transit. This 
single change would reduce uncertainty, accelerate redevelopment, and unlock formal 
housing supply in high-demand areas..  
15.66.	Finally, fiscal effort has to be hardwired into urban institutions. This means 
strengthening own-source revenues through property tax reforms, user charges linked 
to service quality, and systematic land value capture around infrastructure investments. 
Property tax should be converted into a self-updating area-based or capital-value tax in 
all large cities, with mandatory revaluation every few years using GIS and transaction 
data. Cities that meet minimum revenue-effort benchmarks should be allowed to issue 
municipal bonds without state guarantees, backed by escrowed property tax or user-
charge revenues. Even modest but visible fiscal effort signals seriousness and is critical 
for crowding in debt or private capital under UCF-type structures. Central transfers 
should shift from scheme-based grants to performance-linked urban block grants, 
rewarding cities that increase own-source revenue, reduce approval timelines, and 
meet housing and mobility targets. These steps would allow cities to operate on balance 
sheets rather than utilisation certificates.
15.67.	 Most importantly, already in vogue in certain cities, it is necessary to 
institutionalise the implementation and service delivery mechanism. Million-plus 
cities may benefit from streamlining institutional frameworks and moving toward more 
integrated metropolitan governance models. This is one of the principal differences that 

Economic Survey 2025-26
620
620
make Noida in UP49, different from Gurgaon in Haryana after a rain deluge50, despite 
both cities being satellite cities to Delhi. Even otherwise, dedicated urban project units, 
standardised contracts, and time-bound approvals reduce execution risk, which is 
often a larger deterrent than financing itself. States play a role here, but cities must 
own outcomes rather than act as pass-through agencies.
Reimagining Physical Infrastructure
15.68.	With sufficient ground coverage of urban infrastructure under AMRUT, Swachh 
Bharat, most large cities now have baseline assets in sanitation, water supply, and 
solid-waste management. The next phase of urban infrastructure must move beyond 
expanding coverage towards designing systems that are resource-conservative, 
financially-intelligent, and reflective of real-time data. World Bank estimates that 
India will need to invest $840 billion51 over the next 15 years—or an average of $55 
billion per annum—into urban infrastructure if it is to effectively meet the needs of its 
fast-growing urban population. There is no urban infrastructure type that exists in the 
world but has not been experimented with in India, a country that has everything from 
monorails, metros, BRTS, to open amphitheatres, rainwater harvesting structures, and 
more. However, compared to global cities, the gap is not in ambition but in coordination 
- Indian cities build roads, metros, drains, and utilities as separate projects rather 
than as interconnected systems. Moving forward, we need urban infrastructure that 
is integrated, people-centred and productivity-enhancing rather than fragmented 
and asset-driven. For e.g., Metro divorced from ToD (Transit-oriented Development) 
principles, stands as an engineering project rather than a city-shaping project. Station 
areas remain low-density, poorly connected, and constrained by rigid zoning, resulting 
in under-utilised capacity, weak farebox recovery, and limited impact on overall urban 
mobility, unlike global examples where metro stations anchor dense, mixed-use 
neighbourhoods that maximise ridership, shorten commutes, raise land values, and 
generate revenues to sustain the system. Efforts must be made to reduce the project-
system mismatch to build integrated systems. Road expansion must be paired with 
effective parking management, pedestrian infrastructure, and prioritisation of public 
transport. Flyovers should give way to network-level traffic management and junction 
redesign. Additionally, drainage upgrades must be planned at the city scale, linked 
to natural water flows and land use patterns. Institutionally, this requires aligning 
planning, finance, and execution under a single urban or metropolitan authority, with 
clear incentives for coordination across sectors. Shifting the focus from asset delivery 
to system performance is essential if infrastructure investment is to translate into 
meaningful and sustained improvements in urban outcomes.

15.69.	Infrastructure funding should be conditional on city-climate plans, ensuring 
that drains, pumping stations, roads, and public spaces are designed for future rainfall 
and temperature patterns, not historical averages. Cities need to be incentivised as well 
as coerced into designing newer buildings with rainwater harvesting infrastructure. 
Examples of such systems exist within India, such as the IIM Kozhikode campus, and 
can be replicated in future greenfield cities of Amaravati. Grey-water reuse must be 
enforced through building codes, especially in water-stressed cities. Development 
control regulations can require minimum on-site water retention and reuse capacities, 
reducing pressure on municipal networks. Similarly, climate-responsive building 
codes—including ventilation norms, shading, reflective materials, and green roofs—
can significantly lower indoor temperatures and energy demand at low cost. Cities 
like Ahmedabad, which pioneered heat-action planning, show that simple design and 
operational changes can save lives and reduce stress on urban systems. Use of local 
building material and local designs must be actively encouraged since they help in natural 
heat reduction and geophysical adjustment, as is shown in independent buildings in the 
country, such as Solar Passive Hostel, University of Jodhpur52, the TERI SRC building 
in Bengaluru and the Indira Paryavaran Bhavan53, New Delhi. Lessons from the Cochin 
International Airport, which is the world’s first fully solar-powered airport, can be used 
by other cities in similar sunshine-intensity areas.
15.70.	Nature-based solutions54 are also slowly becoming popular to address the urban 
heat island effect in cities in our tropical environs. Going forward, urban infrastructure 
must be planned as nature-based and circular systems, not linear utilities. Stormwater 
drains should be integrated with lakes, wetlands, and open spaces to absorb floods 
rather than merely channel water away. Solid-waste and wastewater systems should 
prioritise decentralised treatment, reuse, and energy recovery at the neighbourhood 
level (e.g., Areas in Surat). Transport and street design must incorporate shade, tree 
cover, and cool surfaces to counter urban heat. These interventions are not about 
adding new schemes; they are about rewriting standards and codes so that every road, 
building, and public space automatically contributes to climate resilience. 
Developing Social Order and Urban Civic Sense
15.71.	 Cities must prioritise rule certainty over rule proliferation: Urban governance 
works best when rules are few, legible, and consistently enforced. Fewer, enforceable 
by-laws, digitised challans, time-bound adjudication, and visible enforcement in high-
friction public spaces are more effective than dense rulebooks that are weakly applied. 
Consistency and inevitability of enforcement matter more than severity. When penalties 
are predictable rather than discretionary, cooperation stabilises, and norms become

self-reinforcing.
15.72.	 Urban design and service delivery must be used as behavioural instruments: 
Urban form and service operations should be treated as behavioural instruments. 
Legible street design with pedestrian priority, physically segregated lanes, defined 
vending and parking zones, and standardised signage reduces ambiguity and lowers 
compliance costs. Integrating civic outcomes into project design standards is more 
effective than addressing behaviour downstream. Operations and maintenance funding 
should be embedded in capital contracts, with service-level benchmarks and publicly 
reported periodic audits. 
15.73.	 Incentives aligned with correct behaviour: A credible civic compact depends on 
visible value delivered by local governments. Property taxes, user charges, and fines 
should be transparently linked to improvements in neighbourhood services such as 
cleanliness, lighting, footpaths, drainage, and public safety. When citizens see tangible 
returns, their willingness to comply rises. Treating streets, footpaths, lakes, parks, and 
utilities as assets to be governed requires clear ownership of outcomes, defined rules 
of use, and shared accountability, backed by professional operations and maintenance 
budgets.
15.74.	 Using behavioural nudges to encourage social contract around civic sense: 
Behavioural tools work best when embedded in credible systems. Footpath markings, 
coloured lanes, queue lines, bin placement at points of waste generation, pedestrian 
countdown signals, and standardised parking bays make the right action intuitive. Public 
display boards showing service levels and compliance indicators shift expectations 
by making performance visible. Default options such as automatic waste segregation 
reduce reliance on individual choice. Behavioural cues reinforce cooperation when they 
are backed by consistent enforcement and reliable services.
15.75.	 System-based civic-sense awareness rather than episodic messaging: 
Communication should reinforce predictable systems rather than substitute for 
them. Simple, local, and repetitive messaging focused on a small set of high-impact 
behaviours works best when delivered at the point of action. Over time, environments 
that repeatedly teach, remind, and reinforce the same rules build habits. Civic charters 
and service guarantees can formalise this compact, signalling what citizens can expect 
from local governments and what they are expected to provide in return.
15.76.	 Efforts to strengthen civic order must recognise the distributional dimensions 
of urban rules. Street vending, informal transport, home-based enterprises and low-
income rental housing are integral to the urban economy, and poorly designed or 
abruptly enforced regulations can impose disproportionate burdens on vulnerable

groups. Rule certainty, therefore, requires not only consistency but also fairness, 
consultation, and transitional support, so that compliance is experienced as legitimate 
rather than punitive. When rules are perceived as enabling livelihoods as well as order, 
cooperation becomes more resilient and self-sustaining.
Box XV.5: The concept of contextual compliance
Behaviour that appears unruly or indifferent to the commons in one context becomes 
orderly, considerate and norm-abiding in another — often within the same city, the same 
class of users, even the same individuals. Orderly conduct in the Metro rail service in 
Indian cities and the queues that greet the Mumbai BEST service are examples. Rather than 
disproving the perception, these examples help explain it: they show that behaviour toward 
the commons is highly context-dependent, and that good outcomes emerge when design, 
incentives and norms align. They transform an “open” commons into a structured, legible 
and predictable shared system. Several features tend to coincide in such cases.
First, the system is clearly designed to reduce ambiguity about what constitutes the right 
behaviour. Entry and exit lines, barriers, turnstiles, marked queues, platform doors or 
painted bays convert an undifferentiated public space into something closer to a rule-guided 
environment. When the environment signals order, people usually follow it; when space is 
ambiguous, they improvise, and improvisation in crowded settings often looks like chaos.
Second, there is a credible expectation of enforcement, even if it is light-touch. In the Metro, 
the presence of staff, fines and surveillance creates a background “shadow of authority”. But 
crucially, enforcement is consistent and impersonal, unlike in many other public settings, 
where it is uneven or negotiable. Where rules feel fair and predictable, compliance becomes 
easier to internalise.
Third, there is high reliability of service. If trains come at regular intervals and everyone 
knows that waiting a minute or two brings the same outcome, there is little payoff to pushing, 
grabbing or jumping the line. By contrast, in systems where scarcity, delay or uncertainty 
dominate — irregular buses, unpredictable traffic, intermittent utilities — people rationally 
switch to opportunistic behaviour because they cannot trust the system to treat patience 
fairly.
Fourth, repeated interaction among strangers in a stable system allows norms of mutual 
accommodation to develop. Once people see that others queue, give space, or avoid blocking 
doors, conformity starts to move toward order rather than disorder. The Metro’s “inside 
behaviour” becomes a social script; deviation attracts disapproval not only from authorities 
but from fellow passengers.
Fifth, there is often a degree of status and identity attached to the space. The Metro has come 
to symbolise modernity, efficiency, and civic pride; users perceive it as a valued asset rather 
than a neglected public utility. Where the commons appears broken, poorly maintained, or 
captured by vested interests, people feel less of a moral obligation to care for it — neglect 
breeds neglect.

There are similar pockets elsewhere: orderly boarding in parts of Chennai and Bengaluru’s 
metro systems, relatively disciplined pedestrian behaviour in some gated or well-managed 
public campuses, or compliance with rules in airports and passport queues. These are not 
simply “middle-class islands”; they are environments where institutional design and social 
expectations reinforce each other.
Commons works when institutions make cooperation rational, visible and dignified — 
through clarity of rules, reliability of provision, credible but fair enforcement, physical 
design that nudges behaviour, and a sense that the space belongs to everyone and is worth 
preserving. Where these elements are weak or absent, behaviour adapts in the opposite 
direction, often producing the very disorder that later gets moralised as cultural deficiency.
In sum, when governance, design and trust align, collective behaviour improves quickly — 
not because people change, but because the system does.
NON-TANGIBLE ASPECTS OF FUTURE CITIES
15.77.	 However, even as the three wise men of Magi in the urban context, i.e, governance, 
financial devolution and urban infrastructure are strengthened, it becomes imperative 
to think of urban design from a future perspective. What should we do differently so 
that our cities look and behave differently from what we have always done? It is in this 
context that we can adopt certain principles:
a.	
Time as the central urban resource: The most liveable global cities systematically 
minimise time lost to commuting, services, and uncertainty. Neighbourhood 
planning in new urban expansions and redevelopment zones should align housing, 
schools, anganwadis, health centres, and workplaces within short travel radii.
b.	
Streets as social infrastructure, not just traffic corridors: Street design can be 
guided by Guillermo Penalosa’s “8-80” philosophy that good streets must work 
equally well for an eight-year-old and an eighty-year-old in order to prioritise 
safety, comfort and accessibility. In cities like Barcelona, the “superblock” model 
reclaims streets for walking, play, cafés, and culture by restricting through-traffic. 
Melbourne deliberately designed laneways to encourage cafés, art, and informal 
commerce, turning leftover spaces into cultural assets. Liveability will require 
a shift from road-widening to street-making, where public space is designed 
for lingering, interaction, and safety. 10–15 per cent of city streets need to be 
designated as pedestrian-first or low-traffic streets, especially in dense commercial 
and residential areas. Road-widening norms should include street design codes 
that mandate features such as shade, seating, vending space, and safe crossings. 
In certain cities, “weekend streets” can be piloted before scaling citywide.
c.	
Encouraging creative density, not just economic density: Globally engaging cities 

Urbanisation
625
625
actively nurture art, music, design, food, and street culture as part of urban policy. 
Indian cities are culturally rich but institutionally hostile to creativity: restrictive 
licensing, noise rules without zoning nuance, lack of affordable inner-city spaces, 
and moral policing push culture into the margins. Making cities engaging in India 
means protecting spaces for expression, not over-regulating them out of existence. 
Low-rent creative zones in inner cities (e.g., craft clusters in Jaipur) should to 
be created using public or underutilised land and with single-window approvals 
for studios, theatres, institutional spaces (such as the Okhla Institutional Area in 
Delhi), rehearsal spaces, and galleries.
d.	
Integration of informality through in-situ upgrading of informal settlements (tried 
in places such as Ahmedabad) with secure tenure, infrastructure, and incremental 
formalisation, instead of eviction plans. Streets need to be planned and designed for 
vendors with formalised vending spaces. The Street Vendors Act 2014, supported 
by schemes such as PM SVANidhi, has formalised street vending zones in certain 
states, including Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Assam. 
e.	
Governance that enables participation, not just compliance: Deliberate 
movement from the current model of distant and procedural urban governance 
to participatory models where citizens are invited into decision-making through 
neighbourhood councils, participatory budgeting, cultural grants, and transparent 
planning processes. This creates emotional ownership of the city (e.g citizenry 
participation in the Smart City Proposals).  Planning documents, zoning changes, 
and infrastructure proposals should be publicly accessible and open to public 
comment by default.
f.	
Finally, there is a psychological dimension: cities that inspire imagination. Cities 
like New York City and Amsterdam offer constant cues that ambition, diversity, 
and reinvention are the norm. Indian cities are aspirational but exhausting; they 
demand resilience rather than reward curiosity. To become engaging, Indian cities 
must move from survival-oriented urbanism to possibility-oriented urbanism, 
where public spaces, culture, mobility, and governance expand what people feel 
they can do with their lives.
15.78.	 As India competes globally for skilled workers, entrepreneurs, and ideas, cities 
that exhaust people will lose them, regardless of wage differentials. Cities that offer 
dignity, expression, and predictability will retain and attract them.
15.79.	 As long as citizens feel ownership of cities, they will assume responsibility for 
it, like their own houses – a phenomenon called the endowment effect. However, since 
the system fails and is unrewarding for common citizens, their ownership is limited

626
626
and often driven by individual values rather than collective sense. Improving daily 
service delivery, such as road maintenance and traffic management, can help reduce 
the cognitive load on citizens and foster a stronger sense of ownership. 
Conclusion
15.80.	India stands at a pivotal moment in its urbanisation journey. The evidence 
presented in this chapter shows that the country is far more urban in economic, 
functional, and spatial terms than conventional definitions suggest. Yet our cities 
have not been equipped with the institutional, fiscal, and planning foundations 
commensurate with their role in national prosperity. Urbanisation has concentrated 
productivity, innovation and labour markets in our cities. But it has also concentrated 
congestion, informality, and complexity of governance. 
15.81.	 Tackling these issues demands an integrated approach. On the supply side, 
unlocking urban land through clearer titles, improved density norms, and transit-
oriented development can expand affordable housing and reduce peripheral sprawl. 
On the mobility front, prioritising people over vehicles through improving public 
transport and demand management can raise productivity while improving liveability. 
Urban sanitation, waste management, and water systems must evolve from coverage-
led expansion to circular and resource-efficient systems. 
15.82.	These physical investments will deliver their full dividend only if accompanied 
by stronger metropolitan governance, predictable enforcement, and a credible civic 
compact that aligns incentives between citizens and the state. Cities will also need to be 
empowered with better finances and performance-oriented accountability. Ultimately, 
the promise of building India’s urban future lies in making our cities economically 
dynamic, socially inclusive, environmentally sustainable and institutionally capable. 
They must work for the everyday lives of their citizens. When cities are planned, 
financed, and governed around this purpose, urbanisation can become a source of 
shared prosperity and a better quality of life for all citizens.

PART-I
FROM IMPORT SUBSTITUTION 
TO STRATEGIC RESILIENCE AND 
STRATEGIC INDISPENSABILITY
India enters the second half of the 2020s with stronger macroeconomic 
fundamentals than most major economies. Growth has been resilient, financial 
stability has been preserved, and policy autonomy has been retained despite 
repeated global shocks. These achievements matter. At the same time, the nature 
of India’s development challenge is now changing. In a world characterised by 
geopolitical fragmentation, strategic trade, volatile capital flows, and rapid 
technological disruption, the central constraint is no longer macroeconomic 
management alone. It is the depth and quality of state capacity.
The chapter is structured in two parts. Part I situates India’s development 
prospects within a changing global environment and argues that future 
economic strength will be determined not only by how fast India grows, but also 
by whether growth builds durable, productive capabilities, reduces external 
vulnerability, and embeds India more deeply into global economic systems. The 
chapter frames this transition as a movement from strategic resilience - the 
ability to absorb shocks and preserve stability towards strategic indispensability 
- the ability to become a source of reliability, capability, and value for others. 
Manufacturing, exports, disciplined indigenisation, and participation in global 
value chains are treated not only as economic objectives but as institutional 
stress tests that reveal whether the State can support learning, coordination, 
and execution at scale.
Part II turns the lens from external challenge to internal change and argues 
that India’s overarching priority is an institutional incentive structure that 
encourages action, experimentation, and learning under uncertainty. State 
capacity is examined not as a single reform agenda, but as a composite outcome 
shaped by how decisions are taken, how risk and failure are processed, how 
administration is organised around outcomes, how regulation is designed and 
delivered, and how incentives shape the behaviour of officials, firms, and citizens. 
Bureaucratic risk aversion, fragmented accountability, and proceduralism 
weaken the State’s ability to act decisively and adaptively. At the same time, 
the chapter emphasises that capacity is co-produced: firms and citizens shape 
whether the State is pushed toward capability or pulled into discretion and 
enforcement.
16

The chapter also examines the ongoing compliance-reduction and deregulation 
initiative as a practical illustration of state capacity in action. Deregulation is 
treated not as regulatory withdrawal, but as institutional reorientation, shifting 
administrative effort from low-value policing toward coordination, facilitation, 
and problem-solving. In doing so, it demonstrates how disciplined friction 
removal can strengthen the State.
Taken together, the two parts advance a unified argument: India’s ability to 
convert current macroeconomic strength into long-term strategic leverage 
will depend on whether the state can act under uncertainty, learn from 
implementation, coordinate across systems, and sustain discipline over time. 
State capacity, in this sense, is the economic infrastructure on which strategic 
resilience is built, and the pathway through which strategic indispensability 
becomes possible.
The foundation of well-being is dharma.
The foundation of dharma is economic strength.
And the foundation of economic strength is the state.
–Cha akya Sutras
We have done well
16.1.		 Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian economy has performed 
exceptionally well. India’s growth rates are the envy of the world. The growth rate looks 
set to continue in the coming financial year. India’s potential growth may have shifted 
higher towards 7.0%. The banking system is in good health. Credit intermediation 
remains healthy. The private sector is doing well and is investing, but can do more. 
Capital formation as a percentage of GDP is above 30%. The current account deficit 
is comfortably low. Foreign exchange reserves are ample. External remittances are 
strong. The agricultural sector is doing well. Monsoons have been good, and a good Rabi 
crop is expected. Rural sentiment is buoyant, with positive real wage growth in rural 
areas and rising rural consumption. Urban consumption, in comparison, is relatively 
more cautious, although the evidence is anecdotal. Contrasting evidence that paints a 
different and more optimistic picture is also available, especially since fiscal transfers 
to households by states have become sizable.

16.2.	 The government, on its part, has continued with public investment in 
infrastructure and incentivised states to do the same, offering 50-year interest-free 
loans. Furthermore, the government has undertaken significant structural reforms. 
Four labour codes, which provide flexibility to employers and fair treatment to workers, 
were notified in November 2025. The government has suspended many Quality Control 
Orders that, on balance, proved counterproductive for the economy, as they extended 
protection to large companies at the expense of downstream producers without 
corresponding obligations on the part of those protected. 
16.3.	 In February 2025, the government offered significant relief to households by 
raising the minimum tax threshold to 12 lakhs for individuals. A family of two income 
earners would not have had to pay tax on an annual income of up to around Rs. 
26.7 lakhs. Together with extremely low food price inflation over the past year, this 
has left considerable disposable income in the hands of households. In September, 
the government implemented a far-reaching reform of the Goods and Services Tax, 
reducing the number of slabs to two and shifting many items to the lower slab. That 
further boosted household purchasing power and lowered inflation. The government 
simplified the income-tax provisions and the language. It opened up the insurance sector 
and nuclear power generation to foreign investors and the private sector, respectively, 
as announced in the February 2025 budget.
16. 4.	 Apart from these reform initiatives, the government has been systematically 
strengthening national resilience by investing in achieving self-sufficiency in critical 
minerals and semiconductors, as well as supporting the shipbuilding industry through 
sustained and persistent efforts. These are covered in greater detail in Chapters 8, 9 
and 10, respectively.
16.5.		 More importantly, following the surprise of the reciprocal tariffs and penal 
tariffs imposed by the U.S. government on India in April and August, respectively, the 
Indian government intensified negotiations with other countries to open more markets 
for Indian exporters. The government also passed a relief package for exporters and 
announced a five-year export promotion package to support expansion into new 
geographies.
16.6.	 As a result of the government’s systematic and laser-focused efforts, the economy 
is well-positioned to continue growing. That prospects look good amid pervasive global 
uncertainty is all the more creditable.
Not so sure about the world
16.7.		 Global uncertainties are not only pervasive but also deeply structural. For better 
or worse, the global order that had prevailed for five and a half decades since the War

ended began to unravel in the new millennium. The first warning came with the end 
of the TMT (Telecommunication, Media and Technology) and Internet bubble in the 
early 2000s. China entered the World Trade Organisation in 2001 and, over the next 
two decades, proceeded to become a global manufacturing and export powerhouse, 
upsetting manufacturing and investment across developed and developing nations. 
Then came the big one – the global financial crisis of 2008. It almost caused a collapse 
of the financial sector in America and significantly dented the world's confidence in 
the U.S. dollar and the American model of post-industrial financialisation-led growth, 
pursued since the 1980s.
16.8.	 The response of policymakers in the developed world was to use short-run 
monetary policy tools as the stabiliser of aggregate demand for a long period. Policy 
rates were lowered to zero, and long-term rates were kept lower through the active 
purchase of government bonds by central banks. These actions further financialised 
their economies and made manufacturing-centric communities vulnerable to social 
and economic disruption. 
16.9.	 The onset of COVID-19 in 2020 and the disruption it caused further aggravated 
economic and social problems across the world. Globally, public sector debt has 
increased significantly due to policy actions taken to address the pandemic. The rise 
of China as a manufacturing export powerhouse, rising debt, growing middle-class 
disaffection, and declining growth have brought about political changes across the 
Western world, upending the international economic order that has prevailed since the 
1980s. 
16.10.	 Presciently, in February 2020, shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic broke 
out, fund manager Alberto Gallo warned that the extraordinary monetary easing that 
followed the 2008 Global Financial Crisis — and the even more aggressive response to 
the pandemic — risked locking advanced economies into a prolonged phase of ultra-
loose monetary conditions. After a decade of quantitative easing and steadily declining 
nominal and real interest rates, monetary policy, he argued, was losing traction in 
stimulating productive investment, with liquidity instead flowing into interest-rate-
sensitive and safe-haven assets, inflating asset prices and compressing real yields — 
a dynamic he termed the “QE Infinity Trap”, in which economies become dependent 
on sustained accommodation merely to preserve activity. Several elements of this 
prognosis are now visible: financial repression and negative real yields have unfolded 
in much of the developed world, while geopolitical tensions, trade frictions and conflict 
have contributed to a more uncertain and fragile global environment. With that, the 
world has entered a period of uncertainty, unpredictability and danger. The new 
administration in the United States is also re-evaluating its approach to alliances and 
relationships and is busy reconfiguring them. Trade has become a matter of bilateral

agreements rather than multilateral arrangements. Countries are pursuing beggar-
thy-neighbour trade policies, and export licensing is now more the norm than the 
exception.

16.11.	 In the meantime, more than two decades after the end of the first technology 
bubble, America and some parts of the world are betting heavily on a boom in Artificial 
Intelligence (AI), reshaping how we work, how we secure ourselves and how we 
learn and teach. Where techno-optimism leads, financial engineering follows. In this 
instance, history may be repeating itself rather than just rhyming. For the time being, 
the development of AI has proceeded along resource-intensive lines. This intensification 
of energy demand is reflected in the sharp projected rise in electricity consumption by 
data centres across major regions (Chart XVI.2). Grids have become unstable, power 
supply is disrupted, and energy costs have risen, compounded by the push towards 
intermittent power sources like solar and wind. Frugal AI may be possible, but it is 
not yet on the horizon, nor is it yet on a commercial or global scale. The US federal 
government has prevented states from regulating AI.

Narrower and narrowing alliances
16.12.	 The surge in power demand has led to a corresponding increase in demand 
for copper. Copper prices have surged nearly a fifth in 2025 (Chart XVI.3), even as 
yields have fallen. Not just critical minerals and rare earths, but even basic metals will 
face supply constraints as demand surges and supply tightens due to both natural and 
nationalistic reasons.

16.13.	 Stating that the 20th century ran on oil and steel and that the 21st would run on 
‘compute’ (short-hand for computing power or Graphic Processing Units (GPU)) and 
the minerals that feed it, America announced a Pax Silica Declaration3 with a few like-
minded countries, aimed at building the AI ecosystem of tomorrow, from energy and 
critical minerals to high-end manufacturing and models. 
16.14.	 In the meantime, the United States passed the GENIUS Act (Guiding and 
Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act) in July 2025, which would 
take effect from January 2027 or 120 days after the implementation regulations are 
issued, whichever is earlier.4 Regulated private sector institutions can issue US dollar-
backed stablecoins. Depending on its success, it carries the potential to disrupt capital 
flows to emerging and developing economies. 
16.15.	 India has managed its external accounts prudently in the last decade. Foreign 
exchange reserves have risen, external debt remains manageable, and crisis episodes 
have been navigated without systemic collapse. These achievements reflect sound

macroeconomic management. Yet the source of stability matters. Much of India’s 
external financing has come through portfolio flows, debt inflows, and episodic surges 
of foreign investment. These flows are valuable, but they are conditional and reversible. 
They respond not only to domestic fundamentals, but to global liquidity cycles, 
risk sentiment, and geopolitical developments beyond India’s control. Currencies 
backed primarily by capital inflows behave differently under stress than currencies 
backed by persistent export surpluses. In moments of global risk aversion, capital 
retrenches. Exchange rates adjust, sometimes abruptly. Central banks can help smooth 
volatility, but they cannot permanently offset structural imbalances through reserve 
accumulation or interest rate adjustments. This is the hard constraint confronting 
India’s macroeconomic aspirations, and India has already felt its impact this year. 
16.16.	 High market valuations and questions over the long-term trajectory of Indo-
American relations, stemming from America's imposition of high tariffs on India and 
its establishment of warm relations with Pakistan, prompted portfolio investors to 
take profits and wait on the sidelines. While foreign direct investment inflows have 
improved, they have not been enough to offset the large portfolio outflows. Further, 
Indian companies have also been required to invest in other countries due to rising 
trade restrictions. One has to produce locally to be able to sell locally. With India 
running an overall trade deficit because the surplus in the services trade does not offset 
the deficit in the goods trade, and with remittances and net invisibles also insufficient, 
India relies on global capital flows to finance its imports. When that fails to materialise 
to the extent needed, the currency is vulnerable to depreciation. 
Deepening uncertainties lie ahead 
16.17.	 As 2025 drew to a close, China made a significant announcement regarding 
Hainan Island. The Hainan Free Trade Port (FTP) is China’s bold experiment to open its 
economy more extensively than anywhere else on the mainland. Instead of being just a 
city or a small zone, the whole island province of Hainan has been turned into a special 
trade and business area with very relaxed rules on trade, customs, taxes, investment, 
and visas. 
16.18.	 In simple terms, tariffs on most imports are removed, allowing goods from 
abroad to enter the island without customs duties. The island operates a special customs 
system separate from mainland China. Goods made in Hainan that add real value (e.g., 
with at least 30% local processing) can be sold throughout the rest of China without 
additional tariffs if they meet rules designed to encourage genuine production, rather 
than just re-export. Within the island, goods, people, capital and services flow freely 
with minimal friction. This officially began on December 18, 2025, when Hainan’s full-
island customs operations commenced, marking it as a functioning free trade port.
