RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
AND SOCIAL PROGRESS: 
FROM PARTICIPATION TO 
PARTNERSHIP
India’s pursuit of inclusive growth under the development model of ‘Sabka 
Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Prayas, Sabka Vishwas’ has yielded measurable 
gains in recent years, reflected in sustained poverty reduction, narrowing 
inequalities, and improved access to basic services. Rural transformation has 
played a central role in this progress, driven by infrastructure investments, 
reforms in employment frameworks, the adoption of technology, and enhanced 
participation of local governments,  and community institutions.
Inclusive development in India emphasises fairness, dignity, and equal rights for 
all, with the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalised groups at its core. 
Government affirmative action in education, healthcare, skill development, and 
livelihoods has facilitated social and economic mobility for the most vulnerable. 
Importantly, the development narrative is shifting from government-led schemes 
to community-driven initiatives, enabling local voices to shape solutions, and 
making growth more participatory, meaningful, and sustainable.
INTRODUCTION
13.1.		 Social mobility and equal opportunity are key to thriving societies and economies. 
Nonetheless, these have been challenging goals to meet. Equality of opportunities 
ensures greater social mobility by providing an equal and merit-driven framework for 
personal progress. 
13.2.	 Social mobility can be understood as inter-generational mobility and also as 
intra-generational mobility, i.e. changes in a person's social or economic status during 
their own lifetime. Factors such as health, education (including access, quality, and 
equity, as well as lifelong learning), technology, work (opportunities, wages, and 
working conditions), and protection and institutions (social protection and inclusive 
institutions) are considered key determinants of social mobility across both dimensions. 
Low social mobility entrenches historical inequalities, and higher income inequalities 
fuel lower social mobility. Enhancing social mobility can transform this vicious cycle 
into a virtuous one, yielding positive benefits for broader economic growth.
13.3.	 Recognising the importance of enhancing social mobility to break cycles of

inequality, the government has implemented targeted initiatives across education, health, 
and social protection. In educational efforts, the focus is on ensuring the availability, 
quality, and equitable distribution of educational programmes, particularly to those who 
need them most. In health, measures include public investment to provide affordable 
preventive and curative care, nutrition, and health insurance. These measures have 
been discussed in detail in Chapter 11 of the Economic Survey. Government measures 
also focus on inclusion and accessibility for persons with disabilities, including targeted 
economic and entrepreneurial support, digital and technological empowerment, and 
the development of social justice and legal frameworks. These steps are designed to 
reduce structural barriers, empower marginalised groups, and create pathways for all 
citizens to improve their socio-economic status. 
13.4.	 The focus of the government is also on making available and financing, where 
required, skills development, especially in the present context of technology-driven 
disruption to jobs and skills. As digitalisation and the use of AI (artificial intelligence) 
continue to reshape work, workers and employers are entering into more flexible work 
relationships. This has taken the form of a flourishing gig economy. There is a need to 
support those engaged in the economy through specific social protection measures. 
These are discussed in Chapter 12 of the Economic Survey. 
13.5.		 Against this background, this chapter examines the country’s progress across 
key social indicators. The first section reviews achievements in reducing poverty and 
inequality. The second section examines trends in government social sector expenditure. 
The third section focuses on recent developments in the rural economy, highlighting 
the contributions of communities, the integration of technology, and capacity building 
to economic growth. The final section examines how social justice initiatives promote 
ongoing inclusion as India progresses on its development path.
LIFTING MILLIONS UP: PROGRESS ON POVERTY AND 
INEQUALITY 
13.6.	 Poverty and inequality are important issues for any developing country. The 
state endeavours to ensure equality of opportunities, eliminate absolute poverty, and 
prevent inequality from rising. It aspires for and works towards the goal that everyone 
in society has a fair chance to fulfil their potential, regardless of their socio-economic 
background, the origin of their parents, or geographical location. Policies such as 
income support, social protection, labour market regulation, and education for all 
help the state in its endeavour to ensure the goals of upward social mobility across 
generations and throughout an individual’s lifespan. For example, enhancing access 
to educational opportunities throughout a person's life is a crucial factor that acts as a 
powerful ‘equaliser’ of chances to improve one's life.

13.7.	 	 These aspirations and policy efforts are commonly assessed using benchmarks 
of poverty and deprivation. One such metric is the World Bank’s (WB) International 
Poverty Line (IPL), which represents the minimum amount of money a person needs 
per day to afford basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. In June 2025, 
the WB raised the poverty line from USD 2.15 to USD 3.00 a day, adjusted for the 
purchasing power of money to 2021 prices.1
13.8.	 With the revised IPL, the poverty rates for India in 2022-23 are 5.3 per cent 
for extreme poverty and 23.9 per cent for lower-middle-income poverty.2 According 
to the WB, India has made significant strides in reducing non-monetary poverty. The 
WB Multidimensional Poverty Measure for India stood at 15.5 per cent in 2022-23, 
reflecting ongoing improvements in living conditions.3 These estimates corroborate the 
estimates of the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) as measured by NITI Aayog.4 
The index measures non-monetary poverty by considering factors such as education, 
health, and living conditions. It shows a decline from 55.3 per cent in 2005-065  to 
14.96 per cent by 2019-216, and is estimated to have decreased further to 11.28 per cent 
in 2022-23. 
13.9.	 Alongside the WB poverty estimates, poverty estimates by researchers based on 
the Tendulkar committee poverty line also indicate a sharp and broad-based decline 
in poverty in India. Between 2011-12 and 2023-24, sustained economic growth, 
supported by redistributive interventions, is estimated to have reduced the poverty rate 
from 21.9 per cent in 2011-12 to 4.7 per cent in 2022-23 and further to 2.3 per cent in 
2023-24.7  The estimates indicate low poverty incidence across states and in both rural 
and urban areas. These achievements demonstrate the government’s commitment to 
inclusive development by targeting both rural and urban communities through welfare 
programmes, economic reforms, and enhanced access to services, thereby significantly 
reducing poverty.

13.10.	 Alongside the ongoing efforts of the government of India, the state governments 
have also adopted innovative models and interventions to eradicate poverty and to 
attain inclusive development. As Chart XIII.1 displays, those states with higher poverty 
incidence in 2015-16, in terms of MPI, have witnessed a greater reduction in the 
headcount ratio of poverty8 over the years, indicating that multidimensional poverty 
differentials across various states have declined over time.9

13.11.	 State governments have introduced innovative programmes to tackle poverty 
over the years. One such example is the Bihar government’s ‘Satat Jeevikoparjan 
Yojana (SJY)’, a livelihoods scheme targeting ultra-poor women launched in 2018. 
The programme uses the ‘Graduation approach’ to support targeted households with 
asset transfers, capacity-building training, livelihood gap assistance, and mentoring for 
a period of 24 months, thereby ensuring long-term self-reliance.10 Beneficiaries were 
also provided access to insurance, public entitlements, and relief support during crises, 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic.11
13.12.	 Another example is the Kerala poverty eradication model. The Kerala 
government implemented a comprehensive method to identify the most vulnerable

households through extensive community participation, led by local governments and 
supported by frontline workers, including ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist), 
Anganwadi workers, Kudumbashree, and activist groups. Essential documents such as 
Aadhar, ration cards, Unique Disability ID (UDID) cards for the differently-abled, and 
electoral IDs, along with emergency services like health insurance and social security 
pensions, were provided to families. The programme prioritised ensuring basic food 
and medical care. Individualised micro-plans were created for each family, with 
regular digital tracking and monitoring service delivery by local self-governments and 
departments. The Kudumbashree network played a key role as both community monitor 
and service provider, while local governments prioritised these interventions in their 
annual development plans.12 The Union government, through the Ministry of Rural 
Development, has launched the ‘Samaveshi Aajeevika Yojana’ programme under the 
umbrella of Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-
NRLM), as a comprehensive livelihoods programme designed to put rural women on 
the path to self-sufficiency, built on the ‘Graduation approach.’13
13.13.	 Both SJY and the Kerala model showcase the involvement of the community 
and a multipronged strategy with continuous support and monitoring to ‘push’ the 
vulnerable out of the vicious cycle through handholding support, training, access to 
finance, and basic necessities. These interventions enable households to become self-
reliant and resilient even in times of crisis. A study by J-PAL found that SJY beneficiaries 
reported having a stable income source, even as other income opportunities, like casual 
labour, disappeared due to COVID-19. 14
13.14.	 These state-level innovations reflect broader national priorities, where targeted 
social investment is being scaled up to support inclusive growth. Understanding trends 
in social sector expenditure offers insight into the government’s approach to enhancing 
well-being and expanding social protection nationwide.
Social sector expenditure trends
13.15.	 Inclusive growth based on the principle of ‘Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka 
Vishwas, Sabka Prayas’ is the government's model for economic development. The 
government’s efforts to provide affordable housing, social security for workers, food 
security, financial inclusion, universal access to basic amenities, and high-quality, 
affordable healthcare are instrumental in improving the overall well-being and standards 
of living. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation’s (MoSPI) latest

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) National Indicator Framework (NIF) Progress 
Report, 2025, provides a comprehensive picture of the impact of these initiatives in 
achieving a transformative scale-up towards achieving the SDG targets.15
13.16.	 According to the report, the population covered by social protection systems has 
increased from 22 per cent in 2016 to 64.3 per cent in 2025, indicating a substantial 
expansion in social security coverage in the country. The population using improved 
drinking water sources in rural areas has increased from 94.6 per cent in 2015-16 to 
99.6 per cent in 2024-25. Universal household electrification was achieved in 2021-22, 
while 100 per cent of the districts were declared open defecation free (ODF) in 2019-
20, and over 96 per cent of Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) villages have achieved the 
ODF plus status (As of 31 December 2025).16
13.17.	 Realising the importance of the inclusive developmental goal, the general 
government’s social services expenditure (SSE) has kept pace with the development of 
the social sector.17 The general government’s SSE has shown a rising trend since FY22. 
During the five years from FY22 to FY26 (BE), the SSE grew at a compound annual 
growth rate (CAGR) of 12 per cent. Expenditure on education18 has grown at a CAGR 
of 11 per cent, whereas expenditure on health19 grew at a CAGR of 8 per cent during the 
same period.

TRANSFORMING THE RURAL ECONOMY
13.18.	 Rural development stands at the core of India’s journey towards inclusive 
economic growth, given that a substantial majority of the population continues to 
reside in rural areas. With 6.65 lakh villages and 2.68 lakh Gram Panchayats (GPs) and 
Rural Local Bodies, the rural landscape forms the backbone of the nation’s social and 
economic development.20 While government initiatives have prioritised infrastructure, 
credit access, basic amenities, and the development of agriculture and traditional 
industries to make the rural economy self-reliant and resilient, it is the third pillar, the 
community itself, that holds the key to sustainable transformation. Empowering rural 
communities and nurturing collective action are essential for inclusive development.
13.19.	 NABARD’s latest Rural Economic Conditions and Sentiments Survey (RECSS) 
(November 2025) round findings show a broad-based strengthening of rural economic 
fundamentals, with robust consumption, high income growth, rising investment, 
improved formal credit access, lower inflation perceptions, better loan repayment 
conditions, and strong satisfaction with infrastructure, all supported by government 
welfare transfers and public investment.21
13.20.	 Furthermore, the findings of RECSS are complemented by a recent research 
report stating that rural consumption has risen to its highest level in 17 quarters.22 The 
report attributes this upturn to firm growth in real agricultural and non-agricultural

wages, higher sales of tractors and fertilisers, and robust farm credit, as well as 
healthy reservoir levels, lower input costs, and steady MSP (Minimum Support Price) 
procurement, all of which have supported sowing activity and farm incomes. These 
developments collectively indicate improving rural economic conditions. 
13.21.	 These findings are complemented by a decline in dependence on the Mahatma 
Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for employment 
in rural areas. While MGNREGS has long served as a critical safety net for rural 
households, recent trends reveal a notable decline in work demand under the scheme. 
Person days generated have declined significantly from a pandemic peak of 389.09 
crore person days in FY21 to approximately 183.77 crore in FY26 (up to 31 December 
2025), representing a decline of over 53 per cent.23 This decline in MGNREGS demand 
coincides with a decrease in rural unemployment, from 3.3 per cent in 2020-21 to 2.5 
per cent in 2023-24, suggesting that many rural households may be accessing non-
farm or other non-MGNREGS work. 24
Reimagining rural employment in a changing rural economy
13.22.	These developments highlight a marked improvement in the rural economy 
driven by strong macroeconomic fundamentals and a reduced dependence on MNREGS 
as a source of livelihood. At the same time, they underscore the need to re-examine the 
design and objectives of employment guarantee programmes in light of changing rural 
realities.  
13.23.	Rural employment has been a cornerstone of India’s social protection framework 
for nearly two decades. Since its enactment in 2005, the MGNREGS has provided wage 
employment, stabilised rural incomes, and created basic infrastructure, offering at 
least 100 days of guaranteed unskilled work to rural households. Over time, increasing 
incomes, enhanced connectivity, widespread digital adoption, and diversified livelihoods 
have transformed the nature of rural employment requirements, emphasising both the 
programme’s achievements and the need to reassess its design and aims.
13.24.	Over the years, a range of administrative and technological reforms have enhanced 
the implementation of the scheme, resulting in notable improvements in participation, 
transparency, and digital governance. Women’s participation rose steadily from 48 per 
cent to 58.1 per cent between FY14 and FY25, Aadhaar seeding expanded sharply, the 
Aadhaar-Based Payment System was widely adopted, and electronic wage payments 
became nearly universal. Monitoring of works also improved, with a large expansion 
in geo-tagged assets and a growing share of individual assets created at the household

level. Field-level staff played a critical role in sustaining implementation despite limited 
resources.
13.25.	 However, alongside these gains, deeper structural issues persisted. Monitoring in 
several states revealed gaps, including work not being done on the ground, expenditure 
not matching physical progress, the use of machines in labour-intensive work, and 
frequent bypassing of digital attendance systems. Misappropriation accumulated 
over time, and only a small proportion of households completed the full 100 days of 
employment post-pandemic, indicating that while delivery systems improved, the 
overall architecture of MGNREGA has reached its limits and warrants reassessment in 
light of evolving rural realities.25
13.26.	Against this backdrop, the government has enacted the Viksit Bharat- Guarantee 
for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025, also referred to as VB - G RAM 
G Act, 2025. The Act is a comprehensive statutory overhaul of MGNREGS, aligning 
rural employment with the long-term vision of Viksit Bharat 2047, while strengthening 
accountability, infrastructure outcomes and income security. The VB G-RAM G Act, 
2025, represents a decisive shift in India’s rural employment policy. While MGNREGS, 
achieved significant gains in participation, digitisation, and transparency over time, 
persistent structural weaknesses limited its effectiveness. The new Act builds on past 
improvements while addressing their shortcomings through a modern, accountable, 
and infrastructure-focused framework (Box XIII.1). 
Box XIII.1: VB G-RAM G Bill 2025 - Reforming MGNREGA for Viksit Bharat
The Viksit Bharat Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act, 2025, is a 
comprehensive legislative reset that aims to modernise rural employment guarantees, 
strengthen accountability, and align employment creation with long-term infrastructure 
and climate resilience goals. The new Act represents a significant upgrade over MGNREGA, 
fixing structural weaknesses while enhancing employment, transparency, planning, and 
accountability.

Wage and social protection measures
The Act specifies that wages will be disbursed on a weekly basis, or at the latest within a 
fortnight of work completion. This timely payment mechanism protects workers’ rights and 
reduces delays that historically affected participation. 
Administrative strengthening and capacity building
Recognising the critical role of field-level staff in ensuring MGNREGA’s implementation 
despite limited resources, VB G-RAM G strengthens administrative capacity by increasing 
the administrative expenditure ceiling from 6 per cent to 9 per cent of total expenditure, 
supporting staffing, training, remuneration, and technical capabilities. This shift towards a 
professional, well-supported system is expected to improve planning, execution, and service 
delivery while reinforcing accountability at all levels.
Decentralised planning and local empowerment
Planning under VB G-RAM G is grounded in local realities through Viksit Gram Panchayat 
Plans, which are spatially integrated with national systems such as PM Gati Shakti. GPs

continue to play a central role, implementing at least half of the work in terms of cost, 
with institutionalised convergence of resources and programmes. This approach enhances 
participatory planning, ensuring that rural development interventions are tailored to the 
local context, sustainable, and responsive to community needs.
Asset creation and national development integration
All assets created under VB G-RAM G are aggregated into the Viksit Bharat National Rural 
Infrastructure Stack, ensuring a unified and coordinated development strategy. By linking 
local works to broader national priorities, the Act facilitates both immediate support for 
rural livelihoods and long-term strategic infrastructure outcomes.
Transparency, accountability, and monitoring
The Act enhances transparency and accountability across the system. The Centre is 
empowered to investigate complaints, suspend fund releases in cases of serious irregularities, 
and direct corrective measures as necessary. Digital governance is being strengthened 
through real-time monitoring, GPS-enabled tracking of works, MIS dashboards, and weekly 
public disclosures. Social audits are mandated at least every six months, and GPs will play 
a more prominent role in ensuring visibility and community participation. Central and 
State Steering Committees provide continuous guidance, oversight, and coordination, while 
digital tools, such as biometric authentication and AI-enabled monitoring, facilitate early 
detection of irregularities.
Financial sustainability
The Act’s financial architecture ensures predictable funding while limiting undue burden on 
states. Normative funding allocations, coupled with cost-sharing mechanisms and additional 
support during disasters, provide a sustainable fiscal framework. Strong oversight and 
accountability mechanisms further reduce the risk of misappropriation, promoting efficient 
use of public resources.
By expanding guaranteed employment, prioritising high-impact works, strengthening 
administrative capacity, and embedding strong digital governance, VB GRAM G positions 
rural employment as a strategic instrument for sustainable development. It aligns 
local livelihoods with national priorities, strengthens institutional capacity at all levels, 
enhances accountability and transparency, and supports the creation of climate-resilient 
infrastructure.
Driving last-mile impact through community participation
13.27.	 India’s extraordinary diversity, encompassing languages, cultures, castes, 
and geography, is not only a defining characteristic but also a profound strength, 
particularly in the context of rural development. Harnessing this diversity through 
community participation creates a powerful engine for inclusive growth and sustainable 
rural transformation. Over time, governance has evolved from centralised models 
(top-down) to more decentralised (bottom-up), people-centred frameworks. The

73rd Constitutional Amendment (1992) institutionalised Panchayati Raj Institutions 
(PRIs) as vehicles for grassroots democracy and laid an institutional framework for 
communities to engage actively in planning and executing development initiatives. 
13.28.	National programmes, such as MGNREGS, DAY-NRLM, SBM, and Jal Jeevan 
Mission (JJM), have embedded participatory approaches, empowering communities 
to shape development through local bodies, self-help groups (SHGs), and grassroots 
organisations. Initiatives like Kerala’s Kudumbashree, Maharashtra’s Participatory 
Irrigation Management (PIM), and the Northeast’s NERCORMP demonstrate how 
local involvement drives inclusive and sustainable outcomes.26 This, in effect, is the 
concept of Jan Bhagidari, or public participation, which provides a practical blueprint 
for narrowing the disconnect between the state and its citizens while building inclusivity 
from the ground up. Jan Bhagidari is supported by an inclusive policy design, 
emphasising that every individual has the right and responsibility to contribute to 
economic and social progress. This engagement can be facilitated through technology-

Technology-driven participation
13.29.	Technology serves as a powerful catalyst for inclusivity, breaking down barriers 
and broadening access for everyone. Innovations like advanced mobile phones, satellite 
internet, and digital tools for agriculture are helping to close the ‘digital divide’, bringing 
vital services to even the most remote areas. The recent Comprehensive Modular 
Survey: Telecom 2025 confirms the positive trend.27
13.30.	Schemes like Survey of Villages Abadi and Mapping with Improvised Technology 
in Village Areas (SVAMITVA) and Namo Drone Didi are potent examples of how 
technology can foster inclusivity in village life. SVAMITVA utilises drone technology to 
map rural properties and issue legal ownership cards, granting villagers clear property 
rights, reducing land disputes, and facilitating access to bank loans and government 
schemes, benefits that were previously out of reach. Namo Drone Didi, by training rural 
women to operate drones for agricultural and land mapping tasks, not only boosts local 
livelihoods and skills but also empowers women to participate in the digital economy. 
13.31.	 As of December 2025, the drone survey under SVAMITVA has been completed 
in 3.28 lakh villages, against a target of nearly 3.44 lakh villages notified for drone

Lead Fertiliser Companies distributed 1,094 drones to SHG Drone Didis in 2023-24 
using their own resources, with 500 of these drones provided under the Namo Drone 
Didi Scheme.29
13.32.	Additionally, the government has been implementing the computerisation and 
digitisation of rural land records since FY08 through the Digital India Land Records 
Modernisation Programme (DILRMP), and substantial progress has been made over 
the years. The goal is to maintain good-quality land records, which will, in turn, improve 
the quality of life for citizens. At the all-India level, digitisation of Record of Rights 
(RoRs) in rural areas has been completed to the extent of 99.8 per cent of available land 
records. Registration of land and property has also been computerised under DILRMP 
to the extent of 95.73 per cent of Sub Registration Offices (SROs).  Unique Land Parcel 
Identification Number (ULPIN)/Bhu-Aadhaar has been assigned to 36.67 crore land 
parcels to date.
13.33.	Building on technology-enabled schemes, villages can be converted into smart, 
intelligent villages, shifting from programme-based interventions to an integrated, 
village-based approach. Technologies can be leveraged holistically to support rural 
development, enhancing the quality of life, strengthening local economies, and 
empowering communities. For example, in Satnavari Smart Village, Maharashtra, 
farmers receive AI-powered alerts on soil, crops, and weather conditions. Smart 
irrigation operates on solar energy with predictive insights, while shared community 
drone spraying of fertilisers and dashboards ensure transparent governance. Students 
can learn via AI-driven modules and digital labs, and villagers can access instant 
telemedicine and e-health records.30
13.34.	The Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAGe) Smart Village Centre (RSVC), 
inaugurated in Mandaura village, Sonipat, establishes a permanent hub at the Panchayat 
level to support 15-20 villages with 12 technology tracks, including internet-of-things 
(IoT) for water monitoring, satellite agri-data, solar power, waste management, FinTech 
apps and custom solutions like animal intrusion prevention and electronic medical 
record-keeping are based on local needs. It fosters community adoption through 
innovations, local entrepreneurs, and collaborations with Krishi Vikas Kendras and 
NRLM for scalable rural progress. This model aims to bridge the rural-urban divide by 
handholding grassroots tech deployment nationwide.31

enhance the governance of village commons, which remain a crucial yet underutilised 
asset where local institutions, digital tools, and livelihood generation intersect to 
support sustainable rural transformation.
Village Commons in India: Need for a fresh approach
13.36.	Village commons in India, also known as Common Property Resources (CPR), 
are traditionally community-managed shared resources that include grazing fields, 
ponds, water bodies, and other areas collectively used by villagers for fodder, fuel, cane 
crushing, water, and livelihood. CPRs were first defined by the National Sample Survey 
Organisation in its 1998 survey, ‘Common Property Resources in India’ (54th Round, 
1998-99), which indicated that approximately 15 per cent of India’s geographical area 
comprises village commons.32
13.37.	 The 2011 Census estimates India’s common land to be approximately 6.6 crore 
hectares, which form biodiversity-rich ecosystems.33 These ecosystems provide 34 
different services that support the livelihoods of approximately 35 crore rural people by 
supplying them with food, fodder, fuelwood, timber, organic manure, and seeds, as well 
as non-material benefits such as clean air, water purification, soil retention, carbon 
sequestration, and flood control. Such ecosystems generate an economic dividend of 
USD 9.05 crore per year, while also making significant contributions to the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), including the reduction of poverty (SDG 1), achieving 
sustainable livelihoods (SDG 8), and promoting environmental stewardship (SDG 
15).34,35
13.38.	Although village commons provide important economic benefits, their value 
is often underestimated, and they have gradually deteriorated due to encroachment, 
misuse, and ongoing pressures. According to Indian Space Research Organisation’s 
(ISRO) satellite-based observational study, Desertification and Land Degradation Atlas, 
degraded land expanded from 94.53 million hectares (28.8 per cent of geographical 
area) during 2003-05 to 96.40 million hectares (29.3 per cent) during 2011-13 to 97.85 
million hectares (29.8 per cent) by 2018-19, adding roughly 2.2 lakh hectares annually.36 
The degradation has led to declining yields, increased cultivation costs, depleted water 
tables, shrinking forests, and the unregulated use of pastures. Non-availability of 
sewage treatment plants in villages has added another layer of complexity.

13.39.	The social and economic consequences of the degradation of common land are 
felt most acutely in rural areas, whose livelihoods are directly tied to their environment. 
To address this issue, the government has launched several restoration programmes like 
Mission Amrit Sarovar, to rejuvenate the village water bodies and SVAMITVA Yojana 
to map village commons and private properties, among many others.37,38 Village pond 
rejuvenation is being advanced through a combination of national initiatives, notably 
the Repair, Renovation, and Restoration of Water Bodies under the PM Krishi Sichai 
Yojana - Har Khet Ko Pani and the Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain, which together 
focus on restoring and sustaining traditional water bodies.39
13.40.	Protecting village commons in India aligns with Elinor Ostrom's principles 
for sustainable management of common-pool resources.40,41 These encompass clearly 
defined boundaries for resources and users; congruence of local rules with conditions; 
participatory rule modification for resource use; monitoring by community-accountable 
officials; graduated sanctions for violating rules; low-cost conflict resolution; autonomy 
for local institutions; and multiple interconnected layers of nested organisations, from 
small local groups at the base up to broader regional or higher-level bodies. When 
combined with tools such as GIS-based registries and targeted capacity building, this 
framework can both arrest degradation and enable rejuvenation of commons through 
interventions like solarisation and waste-to-energy projects. 
13.41.	 Reviving and protecting village commons, therefore, requires a collaborative 
approach that involves both the government and local communities actively 
participating. To achieve this, first, ‘village commons’ as a distinct land-use category 
may need official incorporation with sub-categories, so that accurate estimation, 
monitoring, and informed policy intervention can be undertaken. At the state level, 
Karnataka and Rajasthan demonstrate how multi-tiered institutions can effectively 
systematise the mapping, documentation, and maintenance of databases on common 
natural resources, thereby enhancing the accuracy of village identification and 
management of commons.42 Second, with community participation, solarisation, and 
the establishment of sewage treatment plants that utilise village waste (such as plastic), 
effective use of village commons can be achieved. This will address both land degradation 
and environmental concerns and rebuild their ecological and livelihood functions.

related to rural areas would be beneficial. This can be achieved through institutions 
such as National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj (NIRD&PR), State 
Institutes of Rural Development (SIRDs), Extension Training Centres (ETCs), and 
Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) trainings, which equip officials with the skills 
necessary for the participatory rejuvenation of village commons through solarisation, 
waste-to-energy systems, and sustainable management.
13.42.	Reviving village commons is crucial for rural India’s economy and the livelihoods 
of its people. These shared resources support the daily needs and incomes of millions of 
families, while also conserving biodiversity and providing essential ecosystem services, 
such as water security and soil protection. Restoring and protecting the commons can 
strengthen rural livelihoods, safeguard nature, and unlock significant economic value, 
making them central to sustainable and inclusive development.
Harnessing social capital for livelihood 
13.43.	India is on the cusp of a major socio-economic transformation. It has emerged 
from a period of rapid growth, and sustaining it is both a challenge and an opportunity. 
With around 26 per cent of the population in the 10-24 age group, India’s youth bulge 
demands jobs, enterprises, or both. Employment and entrepreneurship, in turn, ride on 
appropriate skills and education.43 The search for jobs and a better life drives rural-to-
urban migration, with nearly one in four rural Indians (26.8 per cent) being a migrant 
in 2020-21, and nearly 39 per cent of males migrating for employment reasons.44,45
13.44.	Urban India and peri-urban areas attract migrants seeking better education, 
health, livelihoods, services, entertainment, and perceived well-being, viewing living in 
the city as a success. However, cities may be reaching capacity limits, and continuous 
migration is unsustainable, with approximately 65 per cent of the population still 
residing in rural areas.46 This rural-urban shift has side effects: as youth seek work in 
cities, support for older people diminishes, impacting their physical and mental health. 
13.45.	Amid these migration pressures, the path to sustainable progress lies in revitalising 
the rural economy by making rural communities more resilient and self-reliant. This 
can be achieved by incubating and strengthening self-sustaining rural enterprises, 
alongside skill development that generates local livelihoods and opportunities.

13.46.	 Inclusive rural growth, in turn, depends on strengthening local institutions, 
improving access to education and healthcare, fostering entrepreneurship and innovation, 
preserving common resources, and reinforcing cultural knowledge systems and 
community pride. Such an approach also helps address distress-driven urban migration. 
Central to this is the need to operationalise social capital by converting community trust 
and networks into sustainable livelihood outcomes. Achieving these outcomes requires 
active stakeholder engagement and community participation, and several government 
initiatives are designed around these pillars. One such initiative is the DAY-NRLM.
13.47.	 It aims to reduce poverty by enabling poor households to access gainful self-
employment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in sustainable and 
diversified livelihood options for the poor. The Mission seeks to achieve its objective 
through investing in four core components, viz., (a) social mobilisation and promotion 
and strengthening of self-managed and financially sustainable community institutions 
for the rural poor women; (b) financial inclusion; (c) sustainable livelihoods; and (d) 
social inclusion, social development and access to entitlements through convergence.
13.48.	The core of DAY-NRLM is its community-driven approach, which empowers 
rural women by building their capacities, providing financial support, and offering 
training to enhance their livelihoods and promote self-reliance. Key to implementation 
are community resources, such as social capital, specifically, trained SHG members who 
act as Community Resource Persons (CRPs) in thematic areas like agriculture, banking, 
insurance, and nutrition. With over 9 lakh CRPs active at the grassroots, the mission’s 
federations give women a collective voice and agency. The goal is that families in the 
SHG network, for 6-8 years, achieve food security and multiple stable income sources, 
sustainably transforming rural livelihoods.

Skilling initiatives
13.49.	  While employment is a major driver of migration in rural areas, the creation of 
local livelihood opportunities alone is insufficient to build self-reliant villages. Equally 
critical is the development of a skilled workforce. Skill development programmes 
play a key role in empowering individuals by enhancing employability, supporting 
local economic activity, and contributing to broader social development. The Deen 
Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) is a skilling and placement 
initiative under the DAY NRLM. 
13.50.	DDU-GKY is a state-led scheme being implemented in public-private partnership 
(PPP) mode, based on a demand-driven target sanction process. The programme 
occupies a unique position among other skill training programs, due to its focus on 
financially vulnerable rural youth and its emphasis on sustainable employment through 
the prominence and incentives given to post-placement tracking, retention, and career 
progression. To ensure quality adherence, DDU-GKY mandates independent third-
party certification, through Sector Skill Councils (SSC) of National Skill Development 
Corporation (NSDC), of every trainee to assess the skill, knowledge, and attitude of 
each trainee. 
13.51.	 Complementing the DDU GKY, the Rural Self-Employment Training Institutes 
(RSETIs) Programme is a unique PPP initiative implemented through sponsor banks 
in collaboration with state governments. The programme aims to build a dedicated 
skill infrastructure in each district of the country for upskilling rural youth, particularly 
those from Below Poverty Line (BPL) and DAY-NRLM households, geared towards 

Rural Development and Social Progress: From Participatiom to Partnership

531
entrepreneurship development. Currently, 629 RSETIs are operational across 616 
districts in 33 states/UTs, supported by 25 financial institutions, forming a pan-India 
network of skill development and livelihood promotion centres that complements 
national efforts toward Atmanirbhar Bharat.
Capacity building for better governance
13.52.	  Capacity building is key to sustaining the development momentum in rural 
India. Local institutions, such as GPs, play a crucial role in decentralised governance by 
facilitating community participation, decision-making, and grassroots development. 
Strengthening their capacities through essential skills, such as planning, financial 
management, and leadership, and resources like training modules and digital tools, 
enhances institutional efficiency, local governance, and service delivery. To this end, the 
government implements a broad range of initiatives, focused on training programmes, 
digital governance platforms, institutional strengthening, and promoting community 
participation.
13.53.	 Various government institutions, such as NIRD&PR, SIRDs, and ETCs, offer 
targeted training to officials and Panchayat leaders. The NIRD&PR excels in training, 
research, and consultancy on rural development and Panchayati Raj. As a knowledge 
repository and government think tank, it builds the skills/attitudes of officials/non-
officials through training, workshops, and seminars focused on the rural poor. The 
SIRDs train rural officials, functionaries, and elected representatives of PRI, and the 
ETCS impart training to village and block-level developmental functionaries
13.54.	In addition to these institutions, the centrally sponsored scheme RGSA, launched 
in April 2018, strengthens PRIs to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 
emphasising convergence with Mission Antyodaya and a special focus in Aspirational 
Districts. Revamped in 2022, the scheme reimagines PRIs as vibrant centres of self-
governance and economic growth, focusing on grassroots SDG localisation through 
thematic convergence, collaborative efforts between central and state governments, 
and a 'whole-of-government' approach. In FY25, more than 35 lakh participants have 
been trained under the RGSA scheme.
13.55.	 To enhance digital governance, the e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project of the 
government is digitising planning, budgeting, and service delivery through platforms 
like e-Gram Swaraj.47 The project seeks to transform the functioning of PRIs, making 
them more transparent, accountable and effective as last-mile cutting-edge institutions 
of decentralised local self-governments. The e-Gram SWARAJ portal, launched in April 
2020, provides a single window with the complete Profile of the GP, including details

of Sarpanch/Secretary, demography, finances, assets, activities taken up through the 
Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP), and relevant information from Census 
2011, SECC (Socio Economic and Caste Census) data, Mission Antyodaya survey report, 
etc. The portal acts as a unified interface that enhances the reporting and tracking of 
Panchayat activities. It decentralises the planning process to ensure development funds 
lead to effective outcomes.  
13.56.	Further, integration with the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) 
ensures secure, real-time payments, and AuditOnline enables transparent online 
audits.48 So far, 2.54 lakh GPs have prepared and uploaded their GPDP for FY25 on 
e-Gram SWARAJ. Till October 2024, 2.21 lakh GPs or equivalent bodies (including 
Traditional Local Bodies) have carried out online transactions to the tune of ₹2,77,784 
crore (since inception). 
13.57.	  AI tools like SabhaSaar strengthen participatory democracy and local governance 
efficiency by reducing the time and effort required for manual documentation. As of 
November 2025, about one lakh GPs in 31 states/UTs conducted 1.38 lakh Gram Sabhas 
and generated automatic minutes of the meetings through SabhaSaar.49
13.58.	Along with building GP capacities, it is essential to assess development at the 
Panchayat level. The Panchayat Advancement Index (PAI) of the Ministry of Panchayati 
Raj (MoPR) assesses the overall holistic development, performance & progress of over 
2.5 lakh GPs across India.50 This assessment helps identify shortfalls, needed capacities, 
and improvement strategies. This initiative advances the vision of building vibrant 
PRIs as hubs of governance and growth through competitive federalism, motivating 
officials to deliver better services while boosting community participation. The index is 
discussed in detail in Box XIII.2.
Box XIII.2: Panchayat Advancement Index: A composite 
tool to track local SDG progress
GPs serve as the initial point of contact between citizens and governance in rural areas. 
Their proximity to local communities enables them to identify area-specific needs, prioritise 
development interventions, and ensure efficient utilisation of resources. GPs play a pivotal 
role in implementing government schemes and are central to achieving the SDGs at the 
grassroots level. Institutional mechanisms such as GPDPs, Gram Sabhas, and participatory 
budgeting frameworks strengthen participatory governance by contextualising national

priorities, including the SDGs, within local development processes. Further, policy 
instruments such as the Panchayat Advancement Index (PAI) support local governments in 
monitoring performance and adopting evidence-based policy actions.
PAI is a composite, multi-domain index developed by the MoPR to systematically 
measure and monitor the progress of over 2.5 lakh GPs in achieving Localised Sustainable 
Development Goals (LSDGs). 51 It is built on 435 unique local indicators (331 mandatory 
and 104 optional) mapped to 566 data points. The indicators are aligned with the National 
Indicator Framework of MoSPI and organised across nine LSDG themes: poverty-free and 
enhanced livelihoods (32 indicators), healthy panchayat (21), child-friendly panchayat (82), 
water-sufficient panchayat (21), clean and green panchayat (33), self-sufficient infrastructure 
(159), socially just and socially secured panchayat (62), good governance (62), and women-
friendly panchayat (44).
The PAI captures the multidimensional nature of rural development by using localised 
indicators that reflect social, economic, environmental and governance outcomes at the 
GP level. Each of the nine LSDG themes is operationalised through specific indicators. The 
granular indicator design ensures that global SDG targets are translated into measurable, 
locally relevant metrics that Panchayats can act upon through planning and convergence.
At its core, PAI is a performance measurement and ranking framework for GPs. By 
aggregating information across key dimensions of rural life under the nine themes, PAI acts 
as an effective instrument to assess areas that need more attention to ensure the effective 
utilisation of limited resources.
Role of PAI in Evidence-Based Planning
A central purpose of PAI is to use indicator-based scores to identify development gaps 
across themes and guide evidence-based GPDPs. By combining granular indicators with 
a transparent scoring and categorisation framework, PAI promotes healthy competition 
among Panchayats and encourages them to improve governance quality, service delivery 
and development outcomes. The index also offers policymakers at all levels, from State 
Governments and Members of Parliament to central ministries, a structured, indicator-
based tool to assess ground-level SDG progress, refine schemes, and strengthen convergence 
around the LSDG themes.
Rural infrastructure
13.59.	Strong infrastructure, including roads, housing, tap water connections, and 
digital connectivity, has been vital for inclusivity, as it links communities to markets, 
services, and opportunities that enhance the quality of life. Additionally, among the 
poor, housing plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life and facilitating their 
participation in the economy.

13.60.	Rural Connectivity is one of the key components in rural development and 
contributes crucially towards alleviating poverty. A high-quality all-weather road 
contributes to generating additional agricultural incomes, promoting productive 
employment, and improving access to health, education, and other essential services. 
Keeping that in view, the government launched Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana 
(PMGSY) (referred to as PMGSY-I) on 25 December 2000 with the primary objective 
of providing all-weather road connectivity to the eligible unconnected habitations in 
rural India (500 persons and above in plains & 250 persons and above in hilly and 
NE areas as per the 2001 census).  As of 15 January 2026, more than 99.6 per cent of 
eligible households have been provided with connectivity. Moreover, under PMGSY-I, 
1,64,581 roads (6,44,735 km) & 7,453 bridges have been sanctioned, and 1,63,665 roads 
(6,25,117 km) & 7,210 bridges have been completed. Building on PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II 
was launched in 2013 to consolidate the existing Rural Road Network, improving its 
overall efficiency as a provider of transportation services for people, goods, and services. 
Under PMGSY-II, 6,664 roads (49,791 km) & 759 bridges have been sanctioned and 
6,612 roads (49,087 km) & 749 bridges have been completed as of 15 January 2026.
13.61.	 The Government approved PMGSY Phase III in July 2019 for the consolidation 
of 1,25,000 km of routes and major rural links connecting habitations, inter alia, to 
Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs), higher secondary schools, and hospitals. Under 
PMGSY-III, 15,965 roads (1,22,363 km) & 3,211 bridges have been sanctioned and 
12,699 roads (1,02,926 km) & 1,734 bridges have been completed of 15 January 2026.
13.62.	In a significant move towards achieving the sustainable rural infrastructure and 
circular economy goals of the SBM-Grameen Phase II, Chhattisgarh has constructed 
its first plastic waste-mixed bituminous road in Bastar district, marking an innovative 
milestone with potential for wide-scale replication. This 5.5-kilometre road, 
constructed under the PMGSY scheme between Kawapal and Kalguda GPs in Jagdalpur 
tehsil, includes 1.2 kilometres laid using non-recyclable plastic waste, blended with 
bitumen. This marks a first-of-its-kind initiative in the region, setting an example for 
environmentally responsible rural development. It embodies the ‘Waste to Wealth’ 
vision of SBM-Grameen Phase II by converting sanitation-linked plastic waste into 
productive rural infrastructure, particularly in a remote tribal belt. Beyond connecting 
two villages, it connects rural livelihoods with sustainability and demonstrates a scalable 
circular economy model that can inform similar efforts across rural India, paving the 
way for a cleaner, greener, and more prosperous future.
13.63.	The Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN) 
scheme targets 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 18 states and 
one UT, aiming for 100 per cent saturation of government schemes in 28,700 PVTG 
habitations, covering approximately 48.22 lakh individuals (12.28 lakh households).

Under PM-JANMAN, 2,495 roads (7,324 km) & 164 bridges have been sanctioned, and 
263 roads (1,314 km) have been completed as of 15 January 2026.
13.64.	Additionally, the government has initiated the Dharti Abha-Janjatiya Gram 
Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA-JGUA) scheme in convergence with the PMGSY-IV. The initiative, 
covering more than 63,000 tribal villages, focuses on improving access to clean water, 
housing, education, healthcare, and sustainable livelihoods. 
13.65.	The environment is central to the sustainability and well-being of tribal 
communities residing in villages, often located in ecologically sensitive and resource-
rich areas.  Environmental sustainability is strengthened through the Pradhan Mantri 
Janjatiya Vikas Mission (PMJVM), which fosters tribal entrepreneurship and sustainable 
use of natural resources, especially Minor Forest Produce (MFP). Under the PMJVM, 
4105 Van Dhan Vikas Kendras have been established, benefiting approximately 12 lakh 
people across 28 states/UTs. The Forest Rights Act 2006 has enabled the distribution 
of 23.92 lakh individual and 1.22 lakh community titles, covering 233.48 lakh acres, 
reinforcing community stewardship over forests and resources.
13.66.	India's tribal areas present a significant opportunity for green economic 
development due to several factors. The tribal population in the country is significant, 
with approximately 1.45 lakh tribal villages, and tribals make up about 8.9 per cent of 
the total population, predominantly residing in biodiverse forests and hilly regions. 
52,53 These Tribal communities possess valuable, sustainable traditional knowledge 
that supports biodiversity and reliance on forest resources. The economic value of the 
Natural Services provided by India's forests is estimated to be worth a substantial ₹128 
trillion per year, highlighting the significant economic potential of these ecosystems 
(Krishnan, A., 2020).54  Yet, biodiversity science and its connections to human well-being 
in India remain largely unexplored.  Box XIII.3 presents how effective integration of 
traditional knowledge, digital infrastructure and community engagement can empower 
tribal communities.
Box XIII.3: Empowering tribal communities to embrace 
digital technologies and practices
Tribal communities, traditionally, practice agriculture but at a very primitive level of the 
value chain. What we see in tribal villages is an agricultural system in harmony with nature, 
adopting deep ecological knowledge, preserving soil and ecosystem health, and utilising

mixed farming, crop rotation, water management, and the use of local resources, while 
meeting the food and nutrition needs of the tribal community. Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) 
has been the lifestyle of tribal communities in India since time immemorial, and it is a 
historically accurate and visible phenomenon.
Hence, the relevance of this eco-friendly, zero-fossil-fuel system has increased further in 
times of climate change and erratic weather. India's green economy and tribal farming 
practices, while facing significant challenges, possess a huge potential for a sustainable 
future.
Supporting smart tribal farming practices, through technological assistance, policy support, 
and financial investment, can lead to the scaling up of a viable green agricultural model for 
India and potentially the Global South. This can be achieved through locally appropriate 
interventions, efficient resource utilisation, and community ownership, addressing the 
structural constraints faced by tribal farmers. Across multiple states, grassroots initiatives 
demonstrate how tribal agriculture can be revitalised by blending indigenous knowledge 
with appropriate, low-cost technologies and institutional support. The experience from 
Odisha illustrates the practical application of this approach. Since 2023, the Strengthening 
of Livelihoods of a Rural Tribal Farmer initiative has been led by Odisha's Soil Conservation 
and Watershed Development Department in the Gajapati district.55 Key interventions 
include excavating around 200 individual farm ponds and four cluster ponds for rainwater 
harvesting and year-round irrigation, alongside awareness drives for integrated farming 
systems that blend crops, poultry, aquaculture, horticulture, and modern drip/sprinkler 
technology for irrigation. This initiative is supported by a multi-departmental convergence 
for infrastructure, inputs, training, and market linkages. The initiative led to an increase 
in annual income of households from ₹1,500 to nearly ₹90,000, strengthened livelihoods, 
reduced distress migration, and renewed youth interest in farming.
In Madhya Pradesh, NGOs and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) have played a central role 
in reviving traditional agrobiodiversity and improving productivity through frontline 
demonstrations and community seed banks. For example, community-run seed banks in 
Jhabua are helping tribal farmers.56 They promote household-level seed collection, structured 
seed exchange, and local seed multiplication, enabling farmers to re-adopt traditional 
and organic farming practices while reducing dependence on external seed markets. The 
initiative is supported by farmer training, the formation of seed producer groups, and the 
use of simple documentation tools.57
Complementing these community-driven models are solar irrigation cooperatives that 
enable year-round cultivation and crop diversification. A similar initiative in Jharkhand 
enabled Oraon farmers to cultivate vegetables, thereby reducing the need for seasonal 
migration. Combined with mobile agro-advisory services that integrate local crop calendars

with timely weather and pest information, this would enable yield stabilisation.58 Together, 
these approaches point to an ‘indigenous agri-tech’ paradigm, where the integration of 
indigenous knowledge with technology can significantly enhance the livelihoods of tribal 
farmers.
In this context, a proactive and development initiative has been in visualising a Smart Tribal 
Farming Initiative - A digital transformation of agriculture in tribal areas for manifold 
tribal farmers' income, as a pilot project in a cluster of 10-15 tribal villages in various 
Districts of India, in association with NGOs working with tribal communities and higher 
educational institutions with digital infrastructures.59 The initiative is built on developing a 
comprehensive digital tribal agriculture mission that transforms tribal farming and allied 
sectors through digital commodity value chains, climate and risk management advisories, 
data-driven soil and health management through a digital agriculture resource information 
system, digitally mapped ‘twin’ villages, validated indigenous practices, and support for 
sustainable natural farming.
India’s tribal regions hold ecological, cultural, and economic potential. A coordinated policy 
that promotes smart tribal farming through targeted investments, digital tools, capacity 
building, and community ownership can transform tribal farming from a subsistence activity 
to a key component of sustainable rural development.
13.67.	 With the aim to achieve the objective of ‘Housing for All’, the Pradhan Mantri 
Awaas Yojana -Gramin is being implemented w.e.f. 1 April 2016 with the aim of providing 
4.95 crore pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible houseless households living 
in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas by 2029. A total target of 4.14 crore 
houses has been allocated to states/UTs, out of which 3.86 crore have been sanctioned, 
and 2.93 crore have been completed so far. Further, 76.98 lakh houses pending from 
earlier schemes were also completed, which takes the overall completion of houses in 
rural areas in the last 11 years to 3.70 crore.
13.68.	To meet the aspiration for ‘Har Ghar Jal’ in rural areas, the government has been 
implementing the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) since August 2019 in partnership with the 
states. At launch, only 3.23 crore (17 per cent) rural households had tap connections. By 
20 November 2025, over 12.50 crore more households were covered, increasing total 
coverage to about 15.74 crore (81.31 per cent), improving the living standards of rural 
households. JJM has delivered transformative social and health outcomes, as evidenced 
by independent assessments. SBI Research reports a sharp decline in women fetching 
water from outside homes, boosting participation in agricultural and allied activities.60

13.69.	These health gains from JJM show how rural infrastructure directly affects rural 
well-being. Beyond economic benefits, schemes like PM GSY, SBM-Grameen, and 
JJM are vital for rural health, reducing disease burden from unsafe water and poor 
sanitation, and improving access to healthcare.
Rural wellbeing
13.70.	 Investment in improving health infrastructure has improved the availability 
of health services in rural areas. It is essential that this improvement translates into 
better outcomes for people, including their health, nutrition, and overall well-being, 
for development to be truly effective. Chapter 11 of the Survey discusses the progress of 
various health initiatives by the government, highlighting gains in service coverage and 
access. At the same time, while child nutrition indicators such as stunting, wasting, and 
underweight have improved over time, the urban-rural gap remains a challenge.

communication (SBCC) strategies can improve scheme outcomes for pregnant and 
lactating mothers and children by promoting appropriate diets and child feeding 
practices. SBCC for caregiver education and community participation can help 
enhance health-seeking behaviours. Evidence suggests that using a behaviour change 
communication approach through SHGs improves newborn care practices.62

13.72.	 Telemedicine has the potential to improve health outcomes in underserved areas, 
especially when local community healthcare providers actively support and promote its 
use in rural communities. Furthermore, strengthening front-line workers led outreach 
by supporting ASHA63, ANM64, and AWW65  to conduct regular home visits and village 
health days focused on maternal and newborn care, with clear training materials, 
communication guidelines, and technology such as mobile apps, AI chatbots, and 
dashboards (e.g. ASHABot66, ASHA Kirana's M-CAT67 and ASHA Digital Health68) can 
help improve outcomes in rural areas. 
Participatory budgeting and planning
13.73.	 The effectiveness of rural infrastructure investments depends on effective 
planning, allocation, and monitoring at the local level. Participatory budgeting and 
strong local governance empower communities to prioritise projects, use resources 
efficiently, and ensure infrastructure aligns with local needs.
13.74.	 Despite receiving grants from the Central Finance Commission and State 
Finance Commissions, PRIs are unable to meet their potential and public expectations 
due to insufficient resources. Greater financial independence through Own Sources of 
Revenue (OSR) enables PRIs to make more informed decisions on expenditure, thereby 
improving efficiency and accountability. Improving OSR strengthens the link between 
revenue generation and expenditure decisions, promoting efficiency and accountability 
in service delivery. Several states/UTs have established rules enabling Panchayats 
to levy and collect taxes, duties, and fees. However, many states and UTs, such as 
Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Uttar Pradesh, 
Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli & Daman and Diu, Ladakh, and 
Lakshadweep, do not have such provisions, underscoring the need for rules to enhance 
local governance across the country.
13.75.	 Incentives such as matching grants in Andaman & Nicobar and financial rewards 
in Goa, along with shared mining royalties, the District Mineral Fund (DMF), and Goods 
and Services Tax (GST) collections, further support PRI revenues.  Additionally, funds 
from mining royalties, the DMF, and GST are shared with Panchayats to align financial 
resources with local governance needs.

13.76.	 MoPR is actively working in collaboration with the states to augment OSR 
generation in PRIs by facilitating the formulation of relevant rules. The Ministry 
has developed the Samarth application for generating and collecting tax demands at 
the PRI level and is collaborating with institutions like IIM-A on capacity-building 
modules. These OSR and technology reforms empower Gram Sabhas and Panchayats 
with reliable local resources, strengthening participatory budgeting, planning, and 
prioritisation at the grassroots level.69
13.77.	 In addition to participatory budgeting, SBCC initiatives play a vital role in 
empowering beneficiaries as drivers of desired outcomes while strengthening PRIs 
to achieve development goals. The Box XI.9 of chapter 11 discusses how an effective 
communication strategy can help drive scheme outcomes.  Box XIII.4 advances this 
discussion.
Box XIII. 4 Communication for rural development and transformation
True progress in rural areas arises from community ownership rather than solely top-
down approaches. Shifts in mindset transform passive residents into active participants. 
Communication strategies address this by sharing targeted knowledge through innovative 
channels and tools that enable communities to become proactive agents of lasting change. 
Driving behaviour change is a process, not a one-time event, requiring tailored messages and 
channels to move people from being unaware to adopting and maintaining new behaviours. 
MoPR is spearheading SBCC campaigns through engaging digital narratives to transform 
grassroots governance mindsets and practices.  Using the multimedia mode, the ministry 
partnered with The Viral Fever (TVF) for the "Phulera Ka Panchayati Raj" series, featuring 
three episodes, to sensitise the digital audience about the issues affecting GPs across India 
through stories that champion self-reliant GPs. In the three episodes, these films highlight 
own-source revenue through local taxes, challenge the ‘Sarpanch Pati’ (Pradhan Pati or 
Mukhiya Pati) culture, advocate for true women's leadership, and address the impact of 
the SVAMITVA Scheme and digital governance tools, such as the Meri Panchayat App, 
showcasing how rural communities are gaining access to transparent and efficient services.70 
The initiatives embody core SBCC principles outlined in governance frameworks, including 
audience segmentation, pre-tested messaging via mass media channels, and participatory 
motivation to sustain behavioural shifts, such as revenue mobilisation and gender-inclusive 
decision-making. 
Another initiative to enable the transfer of knowledge to the citizens is the Meri Panchayat 
App, developed by the MoPR. The app is a mobile governance tool that aggregates data from 
various GP portals, making it easily accessible to the public to promote transparency and 
accountability. It provides comprehensive details on demographics, elected representatives, 
Panchayat secretaries and officials, development plans, funds received, income and expenditure,

resolutions (Sankalp), bank accounts, and statements. This holistic view empowers 
citizens to monitor Panchayat functioning, while elected representatives and functionaries 
can use dedicated login IDs to efficiently manage their tasks. Complementing this is the 
eGramSwaraj-BHASHINI integration, which allows eGramSwaraj to provide services in 
22 scheduled languages of India through Bhashini’s AI-powered translation, making local-
language accessibility a reality for users across India. By overcoming linguistic barriers, 
this initiative promotes inclusive participation among Panchayat officials and citizens, 
improving service delivery and empowering Panchayats to address community needs more 
effectively, driving progress in rural governance. 
To address water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health and nutrition related issues and 
bring behaviour change to adopt recommended practices among SHG members, DAY-
NRLM has been implementing Food, Nutrition, Health and WASH (FNHW) interventions. 
Under FNHW, the states are developing state-specific operational strategies focusing on 
awareness generation and SBCC related to maternal and child health and nutrition, diet 
diversity, reducing anaemia, menstrual hygiene, diarrhoea, usage of toilets, hand washing 
and management of solid and liquid waste. FNHW component focuses on the creation of 
awareness on consumption of the produce from nutri-gardens, backyard poultry, small 
ruminants (goatery, piggery, etc.) and dairy-related interventions under the mission and 
other sources for improving nutritional intake. Around 6,406 blocks of 683 districts have 
initiated FNHW interventions. 
Such initiatives stimulate community dialogue, enhance knowledge of panchayat activities, 
government schemes, and their impact, and ensure government interventions yield desired 
results and foster changes in attitude toward inclusive governance. Local administrators, 
including Sarpanches, acquire skills in e-governance, resource optimisation, and SDG 
localisation, as evidenced by the SBCC campaigns' emphasis on ‘waste-to-wealth’ and self-
reliance themes, which mirror SBM-G innovations.
These interventions can be further leveraged to improve accountability. Information sharing 
about PAI progress with citizens can incentivise Panchayats to improve PAI scores. By 
promoting demand for services like those in RGSA (capacity building, e-governance), these 
efforts will elevate PRIs as vibrant SDG hubs. Overall, these initiatives illustrate how an 
innovative communication strategy can drive behavioural change, strengthen accountability, 
and promote inclusive, self-reliant Panchayats. 
SOCIAL JUSTICE AS AN ENABLER OF INCLUSION
13.78.	Taken together, the progress in poverty reduction and rural development 
underscores how far India has moved in expanding opportunities and improving 
living standards for large sections of its population. Going beyond the target of poverty 
eradication, the goal of Viksit Bharat encompasses building an inclusive society where 
growth and development translate into fairness, dignity, and equal rights for all sections 
of society. 

Economic Survey 2025-26
542

13.79.	 To build such a fair society, the government, through the Ministry of Social 
Justice and Empowerment, adopts a comprehensive approach to empower vulnerable 
populations across four key focus areas: social, economic, educational, and rehabilitative 
empowerment.  Programmes include scholarship schemes, free coaching, a scheme for 
residential education in targeted areas, welfare programmes for senior citizens such as 
Atal Vayo Abhyuday Yojana (AVYAY) and Pradhan Mantri Anusuchit Jaati Abhyuday 
Yojana (PMAJAY), as well as rehabilitation measures and initiatives for the economic 
empowerment of targeted groups. 
13.80.	The venture capital fund for Scheduled Caste (SC) and Backward Classes  startups 
has supported over 160 enterprises from these communities. The VISVAS Yojana 
(Vanchit Ikai Samooh Aur Vargon Ko Aarthik Sahayata) is an initiative for financial 
inclusion, offering credit support, interest subvention, and working in convergence with 
other programmes like MUDRA71, NRLM72, PRAYAAS73, etc., to improve the livelihood 
activities of marginalised groups. The progress made under various initiatives is detailed

13.81.	 Furthermore, the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is implemented 
by the government as a social security programme designed for the vulnerable segment 
of our society. The objective of the programme is to provide a basic level of financial 
assistance to old age, widows, and disabled persons, as well as to bereaved households 
in the event of the death of the breadwinner belonging to the BPL. NSAP caters to 3.09 
crore BPL beneficiaries. Further, states/UTs are also providing financial assistance 
to an additional 5.86 crore beneficiaries through State Pension Schemes. Therefore, 
around nine crore beneficiaries (central NSAP plus additional state beneficiaries) are 
covered under the pension safety net of the country at an estimated annual expenditure 
of more than ₹1 lakh crore.
13.82.	Aadhaar-based Mobile Application for Digital Life Certification (DLC) of NSAP 
pension beneficiaries has been recently launched in July, 2025. A total of 47.76 lakh 
beneficiaries, as of 13 January 2026, have been authenticated through DLC across 
India. This digital innovation streamlines verification, reduces leakages, and enhances 
efficiency in delivering social assistance, aligning with Viksit Bharat's vision of inclusive, 
tech-enabled welfare for vulnerable groups.
13.83.	For the inclusive development of minorities in the country, the government is 
ensuring universal access to education, skills, healthcare, and financial opportunities, 
while leveraging technology to enhance the ease of living, transparency, and good 
governance. The Ministry of Minority Affairs implements schemes for six notified 
minority communities74, including educational scholarships (Pre-Matric, Post-Matric, 
Merit-cum-Means), employment support via Pradhan Mantri Virasat ka Samvardhan 
and National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC) loans, 
special initiatives like Jiyo Parsi for population reversal and Waqf development, and for 
development of community infrastructure and basic amenities under Pradhan Mantri 
Jan Vikas Karyakram scheme.
13.84.	The Ministry of Tribal Affairs implements several programmes for the socio-
economic development of tribal communities and the protection of tribal rights. These 
include capacity-building initiatives such as the Adi Karmyogi Abhiyaan to strengthen 
decentralised tribal leadership and governance; the DA-JGUA to bridge infrastructure 
gaps, enhance access to health, education and Anganwadi services, and promote 
livelihoods; scholarship schemes; Eklavya Model Residential Schools to provide quality 
education to ST children in remote areas; the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adiwasi Nyaya 
Maha Abhiyan for the development of 75 PVTG communities; and credit support 
through the National Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation.

13.85.	Building on these initiatives for the upliftment of vulnerable sections, minorities, 
and tribal communities, focused measures are also being undertaken for the welfare of 
sanitation workers. This is discussed in the following section.
Uplifting sanitation workers and waste pickers
13.86.	The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation 
Act, 2013, was enacted to correct the historical injustice and indignity suffered by 
people employed to clean insanitary dry latrines and sewers. The Hon’ble Supreme 
Court has consistently issued directions to central and state governments to eradicate 
the practice, and has recently directed that it be banned in six major metropolitan cities. 
The Court has enhanced compensation for the deaths of sanitation workers to ₹30 lakh 
and highlighted the weak enforcement of the ban.75
13.87.	With the realisation that the eradication of an injustice rooted in the iniquitous 
caste system requires more than just laws.  Efforts for the sustained rehabilitation of 
manual scavengers have been reinvigorated with the launch of the National Action 
for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme in July 2023. The Scheme 
aims to ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers. The focus is on preventing 
hazardous cleaning and promoting safe cleaning practices through trained and certified 
sanitation workers. The objective of the scheme is to formalise and rehabilitate the 
persons engaged in hazardous cleaning of sewer and septic tanks. 
13.88.	Under the scheme 89,104 sewer and septic tank workers (SSW) have been 
validated and profiled across the country for interventions. A comprehensive survey for 
identifying SSWs has been mandated by the Act for local governments; hence, a clear 
estimate for the country as a whole has yet to be compiled. The Swaach Sarvekshan 
survey in FY25 covered 4,589 urban local bodies (ULB).  The use of this survey to 
estimate SSWs and waste pickers would ensure better coverage, uniformity in the 
criteria applied, and establish a country-wide baseline. This would help all future 
planning, enable better targeting and more efficient allocation of resources.       
13.89.	The continued use of workers in dehumanising and degrading sanitation roles, 
despite legal and administrative measures, indicates deeper systemic socio-cultural 
problems.76 The majority of SSWs hail from a few castes, such as Valmiki, Mehtar, 
Dom, Madiga, Mala, etc., and they have historically faced stigma and discrimination. 
Addressing such deep-set caste-based stigma requires society-wide educational 
and behaviour change interventions to de-stigmatise and dismantle discriminatory

practices in re-employment.  Civil society participation is vital for the eradication of 
manual scavenging and the sustained rehabilitation of SSWs. Given that the ULBs 
play a key role in identifying SSWs and implementing interventions, a performance-
linked incentive and a penalty for non-compliance could be instituted to ensure better 
outcomes of the schemes targeting SSWs.  
13.90.	As a means to improve safety and increase mechanisation, 85,743 PPE (Personal 
Protective Equipment) kits and 653 Safety Device Kits for Emergency Response 
Sanitation Units have been provided to states/UTs. Additionally, capital subsidy has 
been released to 779 SSWs and their dependents for sanitation-related projects.  Around 
84,309 waste pickers have been validated with e-KYC in ULBs, and approximately 
7,500 PPE kits have been distributed among them. 
13.91.	 Mechanisation of sewer cleaning has been successfully employed by advanced 
countries, and they have transitioned to the application of higher-end technologies. 
Local governments in Japan utilise AI-enabled mapping, robotic cleaners, and suction 
systems to reduce human entry into their ageing sewerage systems. The EU has developed 
automated systems, such as PipeGuard and PIPEON, that integrate robotics, predictive 
maintenance, and real-time monitoring. In India, vehicle-integrated machines and 
robotic cleaners have been developed indigenously. Domestic production of these and 
other safety devices should be scaled up, and ULBs should be mandated to acquire them. 
Private investment in the production, operation, and maintenance of these machines, 
as well as job work contracts, should be incentivised by the ULBs.   
13.92.	Efforts to rehabilitate SSWs include providing housing, healthcare, skill 
development, and alternative employment opportunities. Over 70,000 SSWs have been 
covered under Ayushman Bharat – PM Jan Arogya Yojana, a state health insurance 
scheme that provides coverage for healthcare costs. The National Safai Karamcharis 
Finance and Development Corporation offers loan schemes that are implemented 
through channelising agencies and provides skill development/training through 
government sector training institutions. The corporation has supported over 6,600 
beneficiaries with over ₹53.07 crore through various initiatives.77  Together, these legal, 
technological, and welfare measures aim to enhance safety and improve livelihoods for 
sanitation workers, while addressing the deep-rooted socio-cultural barriers that have 
perpetuated this practice.

13.93.	The idea of equality, that not everyone may have the same outcomes, but they 
should have the same opportunities, is central to inclusive development. Providing

equal opportunity entails tackling the layers of disadvantage experienced by various 
groups within a population. Increasing social mobility is not simply an argument for 
equality; it is also an economic argument: encouraging equality of opportunity is critical 
for economic efficiency since it maximises the utilisation of individual skills. This, in 
turn, demands ensuring access to opportunities and basic necessities.  
13.94.	The government's initiatives to lift the vulnerable out of the cycle of deprivation 
have yielded positive results, as reflected in various measures of poverty reduction. 
Government policies have had a significant influence on income distribution, primarily 
through subsidies, pensions, direct transfers, and public expenditures on social 
services, including education and healthcare. This is evident from the recent Household 
Consumption Expenditure Survey 2023-24, which reports a decline in consumption 
inequality and improved outcomes for the most vulnerable.   The survey shows that the 
largest growth in average monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) between 2022-23 
and 2023-24 occurred among the bottom 5-10 per cent of the population in both rural 
and urban areas.
13.95.	With gains in consumption for the most vulnerable, especially in rural areas, the 
path forward lies in amplifying this momentum through rural economic development. 
Reviving the rural economy through local opportunities and innovation is essential. 
There is a need to safeguard the environment, preserve culture and tradition, and 
promote inclusive growth across rural India. Local, decentralised economies should 
thrive, support livelihoods, and enhance living conditions. Growth does not need to 
be disruptive; rural communities can learn new skills, find livelihoods, maintain their 
health and financial stability, restore household harmony, and access modern education 
while preserving their cultural heritage, connections, and respect for the Earth.
13.96.	While the progress in social indicators suggests the effectiveness of targeted 
policies, sustaining and further enhancing social development requires active engagement 
of communities and continuous feedback mechanisms. Frequent technology-enabled 
surveys should be established to enable targeted, data-driven interventions. Positive 
case studies must be documented and widely disseminated to encourage replication, 
while students, community elders, citizens, and prominent personalities should be 
engaged as role models to reinforce desired behaviours and strengthen community 
participation. Going forward, a framework of shared responsibility and respect must 
remain at the centre of India’s growth journey. By making governance a two-way 
process, we can not only bridge the gap between policy and people but also nurture 
citizens who are proud, self-reliant, and prepared for the future.
