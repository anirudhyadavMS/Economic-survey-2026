  "chapter_title": "FISCAL POLICY: Through Credible Consolidation",
  "summary": [
    "At a time when public debt remains elevated globally, and fiscal space is under strain across countries, the Central Government’s fiscal trajectory stands out for combining consolidation with sustained public investment. The government’s calibrated fiscal strategy, anchored in credible deficit reduction, resilient revenue mobilisation, and a decisive reorientation of spending toward capital formation, has strengthened macroeconomic stability and supported growth in the post-pandemic period. Importantly, this fiscal resilience reflects prudent fiscal policy choices and careful fiscal management.",
    "The Centre’s revenue receipts strengthened significantly, rising from an average of about 8.5 per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period (FY16-FY20) to around",
    "9.1 per cent in the post-pandemic years (FY22-FY25). This improvement was driven primarily by buoyant direct tax collections, supported by tax reforms, technology-enabled compliance, deeper formalisation, and improved corporate profitability. Among indirect taxes, GST collections have recorded multiple all-time highs in absolute terms during FY26, with growth broadly aligned to nominal GDP. The recent GST rate rationalisation reforms are expected to support demand by lowering tax incidence and improving price competitiveness, with volume and compliance effects helping to maintain revenue resilience. High- frequency indicators, such as e-way bill generation, PMI readings, automobile sales, UPI transactions, and tractor sales, point to strengthening economic momentum in the recent months following these reforms.",
    "On the expenditure side, consolidation has been achieved alongside an improvement in expenditure quality. Revenue expenditure moderated from 13.6 per cent of GDP in FY22 to 10.9 per cent in FY25, creating space for productive capital outlays. Capital expenditure was scaled up from an average of 1.7 per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period to approximately 3 per cent in the years following the pandemic, with effective capital expenditure reaching 4 per cent of",
    "GDP in FY25. This rebalancing was supported by subsidy rationalisation reduced leakages from Direct Benefit Transfers, and other public financial management reforms, such as Just-in-Time fund releases. As a result, fiscal indicators remain on track in FY26, indicating adherence to the budgeted consolidation path.",
    "The Central Government, through its Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure/Investment (SASCI), has successfully incentivised the States to maintain capital expenditure at around 2.4 per cent of GDP in FY25. Further, the emerging fiscal trade-offs at the State level, particularly the rapid expansion of unconditional cash transfers, have been highlighted. While these provide immediate income support, their growing scale risks increasing expenditure rigidity and crowding out resources for capital investments, including human- capital.",
    "Finally, the chapter demonstrates that, unlike many peer economies where post-pandemic debt unwinding has been limited, India has reduced its general government debt-to-GDP ratio by approximately 7.1 percentage points since",
    "2020, while sustaining high public investment. Going forward, the Central Government’s credible medium-term goal to converge towards a debt-to-GDP ratio of 50 ± 1 per cent provides the policy anchor for sustaining this consolidation at the general government level as well.",
    "The chapter also offers certain reform suggestions for reducing cross-subsidies, stabilising the pipeline for equity monetisation by revising the definition of government companies, advancing the trust and nudge theory in e-way billing, and reaping efficiencies in spending."

At the same time, wider use of e-seals and electronic locking systems, integrated with e-Way Bills and vehicle- tracking technologies, can ensure secure, end-to-end tracking of consignments without routine stoppages on the road. State Governments, which play a key role in field-level enforcement, would be central to this transition by shifting towards risk-based, system- generated alerts and limiting discretionary checks. Together, these reforms would amount to a significant deregulation of the logistics ecosystem, reducing costs and delays for trade while maintaining effective, non-intrusive oversight for tax administration."

Consequently, only 27.0 per cent of outstanding debt is set to mature over the next five years, implying an average annual rollover of about 5.4 per cent, indicating manageable refinancing needs. Interest rate risk has been limited by maintaining a predominantly fixed-rate debt profile, with floating-rate debt accounting for just 4.1 per cent of outstanding debt at end-FY24, ensuring predictability of interest costs. Foreign currency risk remains low due to the country's reliance on domestic currency borrowing, with external debt accounting for a small share of liabilities, (approximately 2.6 per cent of GDP) largely sourced from multilateral institutions on long-term, concessional terms, thereby insulating public debt from exchange rate and external shocks."

The strongly positive coefficient of yvar indicates counter-cyclical fiscal behaviour, wherein primary balance improves significantly when output is above trend, consistent with automatic stabilisers. Interpretation for gvar can be understood as follows - when the government spending gap (gvar) rises, it reflects a surge in total expenditure above the trend. Consequently, the fiscal deficit increases, causing the primary balance to fall into a deficit (represented by a negative coefficient of –0.709). This indicates that temporary spending spikes are deficit- financed, i.e., the government chooses to fund these extras through a \"hole in its own purse\" rather than through other measures like a rise in taxation. However, this behaviour remains sustainable because of the positive coefficient for lagged debt (dt-1), which shows that the long- term corrective response to rising debt ensures that these temporary primary deficits do not lead to an infinite debt spiral. The large positive coefficient of the dummy variable indicates that institutional reforms and explicit fiscal rules have significantly induced fiscal discipline, as reflected in the strengthening of primary balances."
