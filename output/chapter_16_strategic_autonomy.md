16.19.	 For India, Hainan’s Free Trade Port is best understood not as a single disruptive 
shock but as a gradual structural development that subtly changes the economics of 
trade, logistics and investment in China’s near neighbourhood. In practical terms, it 
creates a large, low-tariff, services-heavy economic space in the northern reaches of the 
Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, which could, over time, influence patterns of 
supply-chain routing, tourism flows, and corporate investment decisions in Asia.
16.20.	The significance of this development, however, lies not only in the competition it 
creates for investment, but in the way it unfolds within a global setting that is becoming 
more unsettled, where decisions about production, capital and supply chains are 
increasingly entangled with a broader sense of fragility in the world economy.
16.21.	 As we write this chapter5, despite the initial impression that the world economy 
has weathered the 2025 shocks better than feared, the situation remains fragile. The 
window for ‘Business As Usual’ (BAU) or ‘muddling through’ may be closing with 
respect to the economy, politics and financial markets. Chances of a moderate to 
significant disruption or a major rupture in world affairs exceed the chances of a ‘BAU’ 
scenario. As a country dependent on global capital flows, India has to plan for liquidity 
and external capital buffers in the coming year. Capital flight, including with the advent 
of U.S. stablecoins, is another risk to watch out for. India will remain better placed 
than most in its ability to maintain a decent growth rate, but its resilience will be tested 
as strategic vulnerabilities persist due to external dependence for capital, energy and 
other critical inputs, such as fertilisers. 
16.22.	Looking further ahead, India will have to be prepared for a prolonged period 
of geopolitical uncertainties and conflicts, as well as the consequent disruptions in 
developed societies. It is quite possible that the period between now and 2045 might 
resemble the interwar years of the twentieth century. Of course, numerous innovations 
occurred during the 1930s, amidst the Great Depression and the onset of war.6 The 
war itself contributed to the growth of industrial capacity that later served the global 
economy well. But to survive such a turbulent period and to turn necessities into 
innovations requires not a defensive but a proactive or offensive policy framework. 
Indeed, the contours of a more uncertain and strategically contested world are already 
visible in the international economic environment confronting India today.
16.23.	The global economic environment confronting India today is materially different 
from that of the previous phase of globalisation. Assumptions that shaped much of the 
post-Cold War period, such as open trade, predictable rules, stable capital flows, and 
relatively apolitical interdependence, hold less firmly today. Trade, technology, finance,

and supply chains are increasingly shaped by strategic considerations. In this setting, 
outcomes depend not only on macroeconomic stability or factor accumulation, but on 
institutional and strategic capacity. 
16.24.	Institutional and strategic capabilities take time to build. They require patient 
institution-building, firms that compete rather than rely on shelter, and citizens who 
internalise rules rather than treat them as negotiable. Capability-building also involves 
trade-offs between speed and patience, protection and competition, and autonomy and 
integration that cannot be avoided but only managed.
16.25.	This reflects a deeper change in how major manufacturing powers now view 
trade itself7. China, in particular, increasingly treats trade not as a reciprocal exchange 
between interdependent economies, but as a transitional phase in a longer strategy 
of production dominance, seeking to sell to the world while steadily reducing its own 
dependence on external suppliers. In such a setting, openness becomes asymmetric, 
where some countries remain exposed to external markets and inputs, while others 
retain the ability to restrict access with limited self-inflicted cost.
16.26.	In a world where economic relationships are increasingly strategic and contested, 
the ability to learn selectively becomes a core element of statecraft. The epic Ramayana 
provides a valuable metaphor for strategic learning in complex and contested 
environments. In the Yuddha K
a, the moment of Ravana’s defeat becomes a lesson 
in discernment, as Lord Rama reflects that insight may be drawn even from adversaries, 
without inheriting their values or methods. The teaching is subtle yet powerful: learning 
is compatible with autonomy. In today’s fragmented global economy, the capacity to 
learn without dependence becomes an essential strategic skill.
Swadeshi is inevitable and necessary
16.27.	 The strategic context has shifted in ways that materially alter the calculus of 
openness. Export controls, technology denial regimes, carbon border mechanisms, and 
industrial policy in the West and East alike signal the end of naïve globalisation. We 
operate in an environment where access to inputs, technologies, and markets cannot 
be assumed to be frictionless or permanent. In such circumstances, Swadeshi becomes 
a defensive as well as offensive policy lever: a means to ensure continuity of production 
in the face of external shocks, and a pathway to build enduring national capabilities 
that reinforce economic sovereignty. The policy question is no longer whether the state 
should encourage Swadeshi, but how it should do so without undermining efficiency, 
innovation, or global integration.

From Import Substitution to Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability

16.28.	Not all import substitution is desirable, and not all forms of protection support 
long-term competitiveness. The most persistent objection to Swadeshi-oriented policies 
is not ideological but empirical. India’s own history, like that of many developing 
countries, offers ample examples where protection bred complacency, entrenched 
inefficiency, and insulated firms from global competition.  Swadeshi is a disciplined 
strategy rather than a blanket doctrine.
16.29.	Import substitution is justified when domestic production is already feasible at 
reasonable cost but is impeded by non-economic factors such as coordination failures 
or legacy regulatory burdens, when temporary and explicitly time-bound protection can 
facilitate learning, scale-building, and productivity gains, when the protected industry 
is subject to export discipline and measurable performance benchmarks, and when 
the good concerned is strategically critical even if cost disadvantages persist. These 
conditions differentiate intelligent import substitution (conditional protection) from 
indiscriminate sheltering of domestic incumbents. 
16.30.	The converse also holds: permanent protection is inappropriate in sectors 
where India is already cost-competitive, where exports are being undertaken at 
scale, where products serve as general-purpose intermediates across supply chains, 
or where inputs are critical for labour-intensive industries. In such cases, protection 
risks raising economy-wide costs, dampening competitiveness, and weakening export 
potential. Similarly, we must caution against protection that shields poor-quality 
producers, entrenches incumbency through inverted duty structures, or severs the 
link between support and innovation, learning, and global integration. The lesson is 
that protection without productivity-enhancing investment, capability upgrading, and 
export orientation creates fragility rather than strength. 
16.31.	 A disciplined approach to indigenisation requires clarity on when intervention 
builds long-run capability and when it merely preserves inefficiency. A simple decision 
framework for indigenisation and protection in a fragmented global economy is 
presented below. The objective is not to justify intervention in general, but to discipline 
it. The framework proceeds by identifying where intervention may be warranted, 
clarifying where it should be avoided, and embedding discipline through sequencing, 
conditionality, and export exposure.
16.32.	In practice, the application of this framework yields differentiated priorities. 
Some inputs are systemically critical and warrant early attention due to concentrated 
global supply or strategic exposure. Others are economically viable candidates for 
domestic capability building, where scale, learning, and export orientation can 
deliver competitiveness over time. A third category comprises goods for which import 
dependence does not translate into vulnerability, and where domestic substitution may 
raise costs without enhancing resilience. The tiered framework below formalises this 
differentiation (Chart XVI.4).

638
Tier I: Critical vulnerabilities with high strategic urgency
16.33.	This tier includes goods, components, and technologies where denial of 
access would impose immediate and asymmetric national costs, and where global 
supply is highly concentrated. Typical examples include defence-critical systems, 
core infrastructure inputs, energy security components, public health essentials, and 
foundational industrial technologies. 
16.34.	For Tier I items, the objective is assured availability under stress, not short-term 
efficiency. Domestic production may be justified, even if it is initially costly. However, 
support must remain disciplined. The goal is to establish minimum assured domestic 
capacity within a defined timeframe, not permanent protection.
Tier II: Economically feasible capabilities with strategic payoffs
16.35.	This tier comprises goods where domestic production is economically feasible 
at reasonable cost, but imports persist due to coordination failures, historical path 
dependence, early scale disadvantages, or entrenched procurement and contracting 
practices rather than genuine comparative disadvantage. 
16.36.	Indigenisation in this tier is primarily justified on economic grounds, with 
strategic benefits serving as a complement. The objective is not protection for its own 
sake, but rather accelerated capability formation through scale, learning by doing, and 
integration into global value chains. Temporary and targeted support can help firms 
overcome early barriers, but must be explicitly time-bound, performance-linked, and 
conditional on productivity improvement, cost convergence, and export readiness. 
In practice, this tier could include manufacturing activities characterised by modular 
production, scope for scale economies, and exposure to competitive export markets. 
16.37.	 Without export exposure and credible exit, intervention in this tier may risk 
entrenching inefficiency rather than building capability.
Tier III: Low strategic urgency or high-cost substitution
16.38.	This tier includes goods for which import dependence does not create systemic 
vulnerability, where global supply is diversified, or where domestic substitution would 
impose high economy-wide costs relative to the strategic benefits. 
16.39.	For these items, indigenisation may be unwarranted. Risk may be better managed 
through diversified sourcing, inventory buffers, or contractual safeguards rather than 
domestic production. Attempting to indigenise such inputs risks raising downstream 
costs, weakening export competitiveness, and converting resilience policy into implicit 
taxation of the manufacturing ecosystem. In such cases, restraint itself is a form of 
strategic discipline.

16.40.	These tiers are not static. Items may move across tiers as technologies mature, 
costs decline, or geopolitical conditions change. What matters is that indigenisation 
proceeds sequentially rather than simultaneously, with policy effort concentrated 
where strategic returns are highest. Where feasible, indigenisation should culminate in 
export capability, which is the distinguishing feature of intelligent import substitution.

A new National Input Cost Reduction Strategy: competitiveness as 
infrastructure
16.41.	 For export discipline to work in India’s favour, competitiveness must be 
achievable and affordable. Resilience strategies can fail if they raise costs across the 
economy. A repeated lesson from successful industrialisers is that protecting final 
goods while leaving input costs high makes it harder to scale production and compete 
internationally. Affordable and reliable inputs are foundational to competitiveness. For 
India, if indigenisation is to strengthen resilience without eroding exports, it must be 
paired with systematic input-cost reduction. This is the rationale for a National Input 
Cost Reduction Strategy. 
16.42.	Input costs of raw materials, intermediates, energy, logistics, and compliance 
shape competitiveness across sectors. Unlike final-goods protection, which benefits a 
narrow set of producers, elevated input costs impose diffuse and persistent penalties 
on downstream manufacturing, exports, and employment. Thin margins in export-
oriented manufacturing, high sensitivity among MSMEs, and weaker incentives to 
invest in upgrading make this constraint binding. In this sense, input costs function 
like infrastructure, as they may raise transaction costs across the economy. 
16.43.	Tariff inversion illustrates the problem. Higher duties on intermediates than 
on finished goods penalise downstream producers and encourage assembly-oriented 
imports rather than deeper domestic value addition. This erodes competitiveness, 
discourages exports, and increases reliance on protection for final goods. Correcting 
such distortions is not a marginal trade adjustment, but a structural reform with 
economy-wide implications. 
16.44.	The core logic of an input-cost strategy is rule-based rather than sector-specific. 
Inputs widely used across sectors should not be treated as revenue sources or protection 
instruments once domestic capacity exists. Protecting such inputs may benefit a small 
number of producers, but it raises costs for many downstream users, weakening 
competitiveness and job creation. Lowering input costs strengthens multiple value 
chains simultaneously. 
16.45.	A structured, rule-based distortion audit can guide reform, avoiding ad hoc 
adjustments, by asking whether an input is widely used, whether domestic capacity 
exists, whether protection materially raises downstream costs, and whether continued 
support serves a strategic purpose or merely entrenched interests. Inputs imposing high 
economy-wide costs without clear justification become candidates for rationalisation. 
16.46.	Indigenisation and input-cost reduction can coexist when their scope is clear. 
Targeted support for critical components can coexist with competitive pressure on

general-purpose inputs once the capability exists. This prevents indigenisation from 
becoming across-the-board protection. 
16.47.	 Such reforms are, of course, difficult because benefits are dispersed, while 
resistance is concentrated. Sustaining reform requires a clear articulation of economy-
wide gains and rule-based processes that limit discretion and capture. Lower input 
costs enhance export competitiveness, facilitate global value chain integration, increase 
employment, and stimulate incentives to invest in upgrading. Treated strategically, they 
allow manufacturing and exports to reinforce each other, strengthening both resilience 
and external stability. 
16.48.	Reducing input costs is a necessary foundation for competitiveness, but it is not 
sufficient for capability building. Lower costs remove system-wide handicaps, but they 
do not by themselves create discipline, learning, or scale. Once the economy becomes 
cost-competitive, the binding constraint shifts from prices to performance, in the form 
of reliability, process control, quality, and coordination across institutions. It is at 
this stage that advanced manufacturing becomes decisive. Advanced manufacturing 
exposes weaknesses that sheltered activities can absorb for long periods. It tests 
infrastructure, logistics, regulation, skills, and enforcement simultaneously, and it does 
so under external benchmarks that cannot be negotiated away. In this sense, input-
cost reduction prepares the ground, but advanced manufacturing is where capability is 
actually built and revealed. 
Advanced manufacturing as a disciplining system: why manufacturing 
shapes institutions
16.49.	Advanced manufacturing matters not only because it expands output and 
exports, but because it exposes weaknesses that sheltered activities can carry for a long 
time. When production is process-driven, scale-intensive, and benchmarked against 
global standards, small frictions compound into failures in cost, quality, and reliability. 
That is why advanced manufacturing becomes a stress test for the state and for firms. It 
forces predictable rules, reliable infrastructure, faster logistics, enforceable contracts, 
and institutional follow-through. Cost control, operational reliability, and continuous 
improvement become conditions for survival, not optional aspirations. Adjustment can 
be uncomfortable, but it is also transformative. 
16.50.	Unlike activities that can operate in enclaves, manufacturing is embedded in 
supply chains and factor markets. It depends on ports, power quality, transport reliability, 
standards and certification, dispute resolution, and predictable administration. 
When these are weak, the penalty is immediate and externally visible. In that sense, 
manufacturing does not merely benefit from state capacity; it also actively calls it forth 
by making governance failures costly to conceal.

Economic Survey 2025-26
642
642
16.51.	 In sheltered activities and protected sectors, firms can survive by substituting 
access for efficiency. Regulatory discretion, administrative mediation, or protection can 
sustain profitability even when productivity lags. However, in advanced manufacturing, 
survival depends entirely on execution, not negotiation, and that pressure reshapes 
firms, institutions, and incentives.
Learning, scale, and the discipline of competition 
16.52.	Manufacturing capability is accumulated, not declared. Early stages are often 
inefficient, and learning occurs through repeated process improvement, supplier 
development, and incremental upgrading. But learning becomes a capability only when 
paired with discipline. Support that is unconditional and permanent becomes shelter. 
Support that is time-bound and performance-linked can enable learning while still 
fostering competitiveness, especially through export exposure.
16.53.	India’s experience also highlights a contrast with services-led growth. Services 
exporters can often operate through specialised infrastructure, regulatory carve-outs, 
or organisational separation from domestic supply chains. As a result, services can 
thrive even when broader transaction costs remain high. Manufacturing, by contrast, 
engages multiple factor markets and public systems simultaneously. Weaknesses in 
logistics, standards enforcement, or coordination are quickly and visibly apparent. 
Why East Asia Matters (and Why It Is Often Misread)
16.54.	Any discussion of Swadeshi, import substitution, or industrial policy inevitably 
turns to East Asia. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, China, and, more recently, 
Vietnam are routinely cited as success stories. Yet the lessons drawn from these 
experiences are often superficial or selective. Some observers focus narrowly on 
protection, while others emphasise export orientation or macroeconomic stability. 
Both miss the deeper institutional logic that made these strategies work. The central 
lesson from East Asia is not that the state intervened, but how it intervened—and, 
equally importantly, how it exited. These economies did not succeed because they 
avoided mistakes; rather, they succeeded because their systems were designed to learn 
from mistakes and to reallocate resources when bets failed. This required a level of 
bureaucratic autonomy, political backing, and performance discipline that many 
countries found difficult to sustain.
16.55.	 For India, the relevance of East Asia lies in understanding the architecture of 
state capacity that underpinned its industrialisation. Without that architecture, similar-
looking policies can produce radically different outcomes. 

From Import Substitution to Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
643

Box XVI.1: East Asia – Architecture of State Capacity
Japan: Bureaucratic Authority Anchored in Outcomes
Japan’s post-war industrialisation is often associated with its powerful economic bureaucracy, 
particularly the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). What is less frequently 
appreciated is the incentive structure under which Japanese bureaucrats operated.
Officials enjoyed long tenures within ministries, deep sectoral specialisation, and significant 
discretion in policy design. Crucially, their careers were not derailed by individual project 
failures, provided those projects were aligned with national objectives and implemented in 
good faith. This reduced the fear of experimentation and encouraged calculated risk-taking.
At the same time, support to firms was never unconditional. Subsidies, credit access, 
and protection were tied to performance metrics, including export growth, technological 
upgrading, and scale. When firms failed to meet expectations, support was withdrawn, even 
if this entailed short-term disruption.
The Japanese model combined bureaucratic empowerment with accountability for outcomes, 
not processes. It also relied on dense information flows between the state and industry, allowing 
policymakers to update strategies based on real-world feedback rather than static plans.
South Korea: Failure Tolerance with Ruthless Exit
South Korea’s experience offers perhaps the starkest illustration of disciplined industrial 
policy. The Korean state actively promoted national champions, provided directed credit, 
and protected domestic markets in the early stages. Yet this support came with explicit 
expectations and severe consequences for non-performance.
Bureaucrats frequently rotated between government and industry, ensuring a practical 
understanding of production constraints and global competition. Failure, when aligned with 
national goals, did not end careers. What was not tolerated was persistent underperformance.
The state withdrew support when firms failed to meet export targets or achieve technological 
upgrading. Several chaebol collapsed or were restructured under pressure from the state. The 
political economy of this system was harsh, but it prevented the accumulation of “zombie” 
firms living off protection.
For India, the Korean lesson is that discipline must be visible, predictable, and enforced, 
even when it is politically inconvenient.
Singapore: Speed, Regulatory Flexibility, and Credibility
Singapore represents a contrasting but complementary model. Lacking a large domestic 
market, it focused on becoming indispensable within global value chains through reliability, 
speed, and regulatory credibility.
Regulatory agencies were empowered to waive or adapt rules temporarily to facilitate 
investment and innovation. Speed of execution was valued over formal perfection. 
Importantly, this flexibility was accompanied by strict enforcement once standards were 
set, preserving trust and predictability.

Economic Survey 2025-26

Singapore’s experience highlights a dimension often neglected in Indian debates: regulatory 
friction is itself a competitiveness variable. Even well-designed industrial policies can fail if 
approvals, clearances, and dispute resolution are slow or uncertain.
Vietnam: Relentless Cost Reduction and Institutional Learning
Vietnam’s recent manufacturing success underscores the importance of continuous cost 
reduction and institutional adaptation. Rather than relying heavily on protection, Vietnam 
focused on reducing regulatory and transaction costs, reportedly by as much as 20 per cent 
in certain periods.
This approach made Vietnam an attractive destination for global supply chains seeking 
diversification. While its domestic technological base remains limited, its integration into 
global manufacturing networks has accelerated learning and capability formation.
The lesson here is not that protection is unnecessary, but that competitiveness is multi-
dimensional. Cost structures, regulatory efficiency, and labour productivity matter as much 
as tariff policy.
The Common Thread: The Entrepreneurial State
16.56.	Despite their differences, East Asian experiences share a common institutional 
logic, i.e., the presence of an entrepreneurial state. This does not mean a state that 
replaces markets, but one that is willing to experiment, take calculated risks, absorb 
failures, and dynamically reallocate support. This approach becomes especially critical 
in an environment where policy is made under uncertainty, outcomes cannot be known 
in advance, and mistakes cannot always be reversed without cost.
16.57.	 Three features stand out: 
i.	 Outcome-oriented bureaucracy: Officials are evaluated on results, not rule-
following.
ii.	 Failure tolerance with learning: Errors are acceptable; stagnation is not. 
iii.	Credible withdrawal of support: Exit is as important as entry.
16.58.	These features are conspicuously absent in systems where industrial policy has 
failed. Where bureaucracy is punished for honest failure, risk aversion dominates. Where 
support cannot be withdrawn, inefficiency is entrenched. In such systems, institutions 
respond to uncertainty not by learning and adapting, but by avoiding action altogether, 
weakening state capacity over time.
16.59.	The East Asian experience does not offer a ready-made template for India. But it 
does offer a clear message that industrial policy has a far better chance of success with 
institutional reform.
From Swadeshi to Strategic Resilience to Strategic Indispensability
16.60.	India’s policy challenge does not stop with institutional reform for achieving 
import substitution or Swadeshi, or domestic industrial policy, and doing it intelligently

in terms of making the industry meet world standards. India also needs to build domestic 
capacity in areas that would make it strategically resilient. Strategic resilience is about 
building buffers and strengths to withstand external shocks. It means investment 
in national strength. Intelligent Import Substitution is the first step in investing 
in national strength. ‘Investment in national strength’ takes us to the next stage of 
‘strategic resilience’ and then to the final stage of ‘strategic indispensability.’ Table 
XVI.1 formalises this distinction by placing import substitution, strategic resilience, 
and strategic indispensability side by side in terms of their core purpose.

16.62.	India’s challenge is that the three stages of Aatmanirbharta that will bring us 
closer to the goal of Viksit Bharat are telescoped into each other due to the rapidity of 
the flux the world is experiencing. A famous quote, "There are decades where nothing 
happens; and there are weeks where decades happen," is attributed to Vladimir Ilyich 
Lenin. We are in a period where decades seem to happen in weeks. Interestingly, Russia 
is playing an instrumental role in the current episode.
16.63.	Therefore, India must pursue its near, medium and long-term policy priorities of 
import substitution, strategic resilience, and strategic indispensability simultaneously. 
There is no time to waste. It is like running a marathon and a sprint at the same time, 
or having to run a marathon like a sprint! 

From Import Substitution to Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
647
647
16.64.	Aatmanirbhar Bharat is often discussed as a defensive response to supply chain 
disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or economic coercion. While resilience is a necessary 
objective, it is not a sufficient one in itself. A nation that merely absorbs shocks remains 
reactive. A nation that shapes outcomes becomes influential. This is a higher bar than 
self-sufficiency and a more demanding aspiration than resilience. 
This distinction between resilience and influence is also reflected in external comparative 
assessments of economic power in Asia, discussed in Box XVI.2.
Box XVI.2: From Resilience to Influence - India’s Power Gap in Asia
Recent external assessments reinforce the distinction between resilience and influence. The 
Lowy Institute’s Asia Power Index (2025)8 provides a useful lens in this regard.
The Index distinguishes between resources (what countries possess) and influence (how 
effectively those resources are translated into regional outcomes). It also introduces the 
concept of a Power Gap, which measures the divergence between a country’s expected 
influence based on its resources and its realised influence.
India’s profile in the Index is instructive. India has now reached major power status in 
Asia, and its overall power continues to grow steadily. For the first time since the Index 
was launched in 2018, India’s ranking on economic relationships has improved. Notably, 
India has overtaken China as the leading destination for inward investment in Asia, after the 
United States, measured on a ten-year cumulative basis. This reflects both the geopolitical 
diversification of supply chains and India’s growing attractiveness as an investment 
destination.
At the same time, the Index highlights persistent gaps. India ranks 3rd in overall power, but 
10th in economic relationships, and records a negative Power Gap (–4.o), indicating that 
India is not yet translating its resources into external economic influence. 
The picture that emerges is mixed but revealing. India has demonstrated strong resilience 
and absorptive capacity in the face of global shocks. The next phase of its development 
challenge is different: to move from being primarily a recipient of stability to becoming a 
source of stability and opportunity for others.
This transition from resilience to interdependence is central to India’s journey towards 
Viksit Bharat. It underscores that competitiveness, export capability, and deep integration 
into regional and global production networks are essential instruments of influence in a 
fragmented world.
16.65.	The highest form of economic power is influence exercised without coercion, 
when others align with our interests because it is in their interest to do so. Strategic 
indispensability delivers precisely this form of power. With strategic indispensability 
comes global influence. When global firms rely on Indian production, when supply

chains cannot be easily reconfigured without India, and when Indian exports are trusted 
by default, the country’s voice carries weight beyond its borders. This is the promise of 
Aatmanirbhar Bharat grounded in strategy. 
16.66.	In simple terms, when the world moves from ‘thinking about buying Indian’ to 
‘buying Indian without thinking’, India will have attained strategic indispensability. The 
Prime Minister threw down the gauntlet to the industry in his address to the nation on 
Independence Day, when he said that Swadeshi meant producing goods of the highest 
quality at the lowest possible price, so that people would be automatically drawn to 
buying Indian.
Manufacturing, Export capability, and currency strength
16.67.	 Swadeshi must not be judged solely by import reduction, but by the creation of 
export capability. Creating capability is both urgent and important in a world where 
capital flows are increasingly shaped by shifting geopolitical alignments and national 
interests rather than neutral market forces. As India's economy grows, its imports are 
expected to rise. This is evidenced in the history of economic development over the 
last two centuries, and is therefore not a policy failure. In reality, import growth is 
inevitable and even desirable as incomes rise and economies diversify. Chart XVI.5 
illustrates this pattern by showing that China’s imports rose as its per-capita income 
increased, even as China became a top global producer of goods ranging from steel and 
cement to fertilisers, cars, and drones.

16.68.	In India’s case, such inevitable import growth also brings currency vulnerability 
into sharper focus. As a rising economic power, it is reasonable for India to aspire to

a strong and stable currency. Currency strength is often associated with advanced 
economies. However, the notion of a “hard currency” is frequently misunderstood as 
being driven only by monetary orthodoxy or central bank credibility. While these are 
necessary conditions, they are not sufficient.
16.69.	The exchange rate is best understood as a signal rather than a policy objective. It 
reflects a combination of trade balances, capital flows, risk perceptions, and geopolitics. 
Hard-currency behaviour emerges when markets believe that a country can earn foreign 
exchange reliably through trade, that external liabilities are matched by productive 
external assets, that the economy can withstand shocks without emergency financing, 
and that currency depreciation is not the primary adjustment mechanism.
16.70.	Historically, currencies that exhibit such behaviour, including those of Germany, 
Japan, Switzerland, and later East Asian industrialisers, have rested on their export 
capabilities rather than dependence on capital inflows. Monetary discipline reinforced 
this foundation; it did not create it. Capital inflows can support growth, but they are 
reversible. Export earnings, by contrast, are earned repeatedly through competitiveness 
rather than confidence alone. India’s currency, by contrast, remains structurally soft. 
This is not a failure of policy, but a reflection of underlying trade dynamics. As long 
as economic growth mechanically widens the trade deficit, the exchange rate must 
continue to act as a buffer against external pressure. 
16.71.	 Currency depreciation will therefore remain the primary adjustment mechanism 
unless export capabilities are developed rapidly. The export capability envisaged 
here primarily refers to manufacturing exports, not service exports, in which India 
has achieved remarkable success. India’s performance in IT, business services, and 
professional services has been extraordinary. These exports have generated foreign 
exchange, supported growth, and deepened global integration. However, services 
exports face intrinsic limitations. They are less employment-intensive at scale, 
generate fewer backward linkages, rely heavily on open digital regimes, and do not 
anchor physical supply chains. They are necessary, but insufficient to counterbalance 
the import intensity of industrialisation. Manufacturing exports, by contrast, create 
supplier ecosystems, absorb large workforces, and generate durable trade surpluses 
when scaled. They remain the only proven route through which late-industrialising 
economies have achieved lasting external strength.
Route to Strategic Indispensability runs through Global Value Chains
16.72.	 Manufacturing export capability does not emerge overnight. Its foundations 
are scale, reliability, and integration built over time through disciplined capability 
building. Integration refers to embedding Indian firms into global value chains as well 
as embedding global production systems within India.

16.73.	 Global trade is increasingly concentrated around a relatively small set of 
multinational production networks. This reinforces the importance of attracting such 
firms to India, not merely as sources of capital, but as anchors of export capability and 
currency strength. 
16.74.	 Foreign Direct Investment is not a homogeneous category. The identity of 
investors matters as much as the volume of investment. A small number of global 
brands, particularly in electronics, machinery, apparel, automotive, and consumer 
goods, account for a disproportionate share of world trade. 
16.75.	 Evidence from global trade data suggests that nearly half of the developed world’s 
imports from China originate from the supply chains of roughly fifty multinational 
brands. These firms do not merely assemble products. They orchestrate ecosystems 
comprising supplier networks, logistics platforms, quality systems, and continuous 
design feedback loops that shape entire industries. 
16.76.	 For India, attracting such firms is not about prestige. It is about accelerating 
ecosystem formation. When a global brand commits at scale, suppliers follow, skills 
deepen, standards rise, and exports become endogenous rather than policy-driven. 
This represents the fastest route from Swadeshi as capability-building to Swadeshi as 
strategic indispensability. 
The Role of the State 
16.77.	 The state’s role in this vision is demanding. It must be firm in enforcing 
discipline, flexible in adapting rules, and fair in allocating support. Firmness ensures 
that protection does not become entitlement. Flexibility allows policy to respond to 
feedback rather than assumptions. Fairness preserves legitimacy and prevents capture. 
Balancing these attributes is difficult, but not optional. States that fail on any one 
dimension either stifle initiative, entrench inefficiency, or provoke backlash. 
16.78.	India’s diversity and federal structure are often cited as constraints on its 
development. In reality, they can be sources of strength. Different states possess 
different endowments, geographic, demographic, and institutional, and can specialise 
accordingly. A national Swadeshi strategy should enable competition among states, 
reward outcomes, and disseminate best practices. The government’s task is to set 
direction, remove frictions, and provide credibility. 
16.79.	 The journey from resilience to indispensability can be but need not be long. It 
requires patience, discipline, and institutional courage. But it is neither unprecedented 
nor unattainable. India has the scale, the talent, and the democratic legitimacy to 
attempt it. What remains is alignment between intent and execution, between policy

and institutions, between short-term pressures and long-term goals. If that alignment 
is achieved, Aatmanirbhar Bharat will be remembered as a doctrine of confident 
integration in a fractured world. To achieve the right alignment, we must reimagine the 
state. That is what we turn to in Part II of the Chapter.
