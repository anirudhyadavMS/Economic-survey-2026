  "summary": [
    "India’s agriculture sector has shown robust growth in recent years. Given the large proportion of the population supported by the sector and its crucial role in food security, sustained agricultural growth is imperative for strengthening economic resilience, promoting rural prosperity, and ensuring food security.",
    "Government initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Agriculture Infrastructure",
    "Fund (AIF), and Kisan Credit Cards (KCC), have helped enhance agricultural productivity, encourage crop diversification and increase farm incomes.",
    "Additionally, the buoyant growth of allied sectors has positively contributed to agricultural performance.",
    "While there have been notable advancements in Indian agriculture, challenges that impact productivity and incomes still need to be fully addressed. Fragmented landholdings, inadequate marketing and storage infrastructure, limited access to quality inputs, relatively low levels of investment, and uneven quality of extension services are among the prominent reasons for the low productivity level. These factors collectively affect resilience and farmers' incomes. Certain measures aimed at enhancing fertiliser use among farmers, such as the urea subsidy, have led to increased application. This increased usage has been reported to impact soil productivity negatively.",
    "This chapter examines these constraints while highlighting the policy measures and institutional interventions undertaken by the government to support farmers, enhance productivity, and strengthen market linkages. It also reviews key welfare schemes and income-support mechanisms designed to reduce risk and provide support.",
    "Additionally, the chapter examines India’s food management system, encompassing procurement, storage, and public distribution, to evaluate how food security objectives are achieved. It discusses the functioning of food procurement and distribution mechanisms to ensure stable supplies, provide price support for farmers, and ensure affordable access to foodgrains for consumers."

Key elements of such a roadmap could include accelerating yield improvements in pulses and oilseeds to restore their relative profitability, avoiding distortions in input and output markets that confer an undue advantage to specific feedstocks, and enabling targeted, planned growth of ethanol feedstocks aligned with regional resource endowments. Such an approach would preserve the economic logic of ethanol expansion while ensuring that energy security objectives are pursued without unintentionally weakening food security or nutritional outcomes."
