    "9.62 At the same time, the concept of infrastructure is evolving beyond physical networks to encompass digital public infrastructure, clean energy systems, resilient water management and future-ready technologies. This widened infrastructure base is also enhancing productivity, competitiveness, innovation and sustainability across the economy. Looking ahead, maintaining investment momentum, deepening private participation and aligning infrastructure development with emerging priorities—such as decarbonisation, digitalisation and resilience—will be critical. Together, these efforts position infrastructure as a central pillar of India’s medium-term growth strategy and a key enabler of its long-term development vision under Viksit Bharat @2047.",
    "***",
    "INDIA India aims to become a developed nation by 2047, which requires achieving high, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable growth. This will necessitate a transformation in consumption and production patterns, as well as technological and policy reforms. Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) emphasises the importance of behavioural changes and citizen participation in India's approach to climate action and sustainability, working alongside government- led mitigation and adaptation efforts.",
    "Although India’s per capita emissions remain well below the global average, climate change poses risks to livelihoods, infrastructure, and economic stability.",
    "Adaptation is, therefore, central to India’s climate strategy, driven primarily by public investment and community-based action. The chapter examines how State Action Plans on Climate Change integrate water security, resilient livelihoods, urban resilience, and ecosystem restoration into development objectives, ensuring that development gains are sustained.",
    "India is also pursuing a balanced mitigation pathway, scaling renewables, battery storage, and nuclear energy in line with the objective of energy security and industrial competitiveness. However, inadequate global capital flows to developing countries remain a significant constraint, underscoring the need to reform multilateral financial institutions and to strengthen domestic financial systems. The chapter further reviews the evolution of environmental regulations and their role in enabling sustainable development."

Nowhere is this tension more visible than in parts of Europe, which have presented themselves as the vanguard of the energy transition but are now confronting the practical and institutional stresses that follow from rapid decarbonisation undertaken ahead of grid readiness, storage depth, and industrial system resilience.1 These developments matter deeply for emerging economies such as India because they reveal the structural nature of transition risk, the importance of sequencing, and the consequences of allowing complexity to outpace institutional capacity."

In the Netherlands, celebrated as a leader in renewables and electric mobility, the rapid deployment of solar and wind energy has collided with a distribution network designed for an earlier era of centralised thermal generation.2 The result has been congestion, curtailment, and long waiting times for industrial connections, as well as appeals to households to moderate evening consumption to avoid overloading the system. The challenge here is not ideological, but infrastructural: renewable capacity has expanded faster than balancing systems, transmission reinforcement and storage technologies. The consequence is that intermittency-related costs — from maintaining thermal reserves to the capital burden of grid upgrades — are felt in both reliability stress and headline tariffs."

Across this subset, nearly 95 per cent of sites show no statistically significant acceleration in sea-level rise, and projected rates are, on average, about two millimetres per year higher than those observed, with the limited instances of acceleration largely associated with local, non-climatic factors, such as subsidence or land-use-driven ground movement.5 The implication is not to downplay"

Climate change will have meaningful consequences, but it is unlikely to produce civilisational collapse; innovation, declining green-cost premia and targeted investments are more durable low-carbon pathways than rapidly imposed constraints that erode growth. Equally, scarce fiscal resources should not be diverted away from health, agriculture and poverty reduction merely to accelerate near-term mitigation milestones. Growth and prosperity strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability, and must therefore be treated as complementary to climate strategy rather than competing with it."

As renewable penetration rises, the cost of maintaining dispatchable thermal capacity increases, even as utilisation declines, while grid stability challenges intensify.

Using public sector funds to de- risk climate projects for private investors can create liabilities and put more pressure on the limited fiscal space if the risks materialise. Strategies for scaling finance for climate action should strike a balance between attracting investment and the need for fiscal responsibility, transparency, and long-term debt sustainability. In that regard, it is to be mindful of the fact that excessive use of foreign currency borrowing also exposes projects to exchange rate risks, increasing forex premiums and financing costs, ultimately impacting consistency in climate action. Strong governance frameworks are necessary to ensure that climate finance supports growth and resilience without compromising macroeconomic stability."
