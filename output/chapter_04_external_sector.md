EXTERNAL SECTOR: PLAYING 
THE LONG GAME
India’s external sector has evolved amidst a global environment characterised by 
heightened trade policy uncertainty, geopolitical realignments, and a structural 
shift away from a hyper-globalisation phase. The reconfiguration of global trade 
and investment flows, increasingly influenced by considerations of national 
security, technological sovereignty, and strategic autonomy, has introduced 
both new constraints and opportunities for emerging economies. In this 
changing environment, India’s external performance demonstrates resilience 
to global shocks and highlights the structural characteristics associated with a 
rapidly growing economy that is integrating more deeply into global markets.
On the trade front, India’s total exports reached record levels of USD 825.3 
billion in FY25 and USD 418.5 billion in H1 FY26, driven by strong growth 
in services exports and sustained momentum in non-petroleum, non-gems, 
and jewellery exports. The expansion of higher-value manufacturing exports, 
especially in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and electrical machinery, along with 
diversification of export destinations and import sources, has strengthened 
resilience amid rising protectionism and tariff uncertainties. The services trade 
surplus remains a key stabilising factor, consistently offsetting a large portion of 
the merchandise trade deficit, supported by strong growth in software, business 
services, and the expanding role of Global Capability Centres.
India’s current account remains stable, buoyed by robust inflows from services 
exports and remittances. On the capital account, India has attracted significant 
gross investment inflows despite a subdued global environment for foreign 
direct investment (FDI) and volatile portfolio flows. Gross FDI inflows have 
remained resilient, supported by equity investments and greenfield projects, 
while portfolio flows have been volatile, reflecting global financial conditions. 
External buffers have further strengthened, with foreign exchange reserves 
providing comfortable import cover and robust protection against external 
liabilities. India’s international investment position has steadily improved, and 
its external debt remains moderate, with a favourable maturity profile and high 
reserve coverage.

fragmented and cautious world is emerging, one where protectionist instincts are 
taking precedence over outreach for imports, supply chains are being recalibrated in 
response to geopolitical shifts, and the terms of engagement are shifting more toward 
bilateralism. While the full impact of recent trade policy shifts on global value chains 
(GVC) is still unfolding, the vulnerabilities are already visible. Accordingly, economies 
likely to be impacted by these sudden shifts are now turning inward, strategically seeking to 
fortify their domestic capacities and reduce overdependence on transnational value chains.
4.2	 This pivot is not merely a cyclical adjustment in the aftermath of the COVID-19 
pandemic-induced disruptions; it marks a secular shift in the way the global order is 
structured. The Trade Policy Uncertainty (TPU) Index and the Global Economic Policy 
Uncertainty (GEPU) Index peaked in April 2025, driven by three converging factors: 
the weakening of regional and multilateral trade agreements that had previously 
provided stability, countries' pursuit of sovereign interests through industrial policies, 
and intensifying competition for rare earth minerals. (UNCTAD, 2025).1
4.3	 The global economy continues to adapt to a landscape reshaped by new policy 
measures. While some of the extreme effects of higher tariffs have been mitigated 
through subsequent agreements and adjustments, the overall environment remains 
volatile. The contours of global integration are being redrawn with national security, 
technological sovereignty, and the quest for resilience at the core. 
4.4	 India's external sector includes international trade, investment, capital flows, and 
external debt, and plays a vital role in shaping the country's economic performance 
and its integration with the global economy. All these developments have profound 
implications for a developing economy like India, as this altered milieu presents both 
constraints and transformative opportunities. 
4.5	 Against this backdrop, this chapter examines India’s external sector performance 
within the prevailing global environment. Section I presents the emerging global trade 
dynamics serving as the background for further commentary in the chapter. Section II 
examines trends in India’s trade performance across both the merchandise and services 
sectors. This section particularly emphasises the performance of the Production-Linked 
Incentive (PLI) sectors and the diversification of the country’s export destinations. 
Section III presents India’s Balance of Payments (BoP) situation, highlighting current 
and capital account trends, foreign exchange reserves, exchange rate movements, and 
India’s external debt position.  The last section concludes the chapter with an outlook for 
India’s external sector, considering the evolving global and domestic economic landscape. 
GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS
4.6	 The current global order faces three concurrent challenges: trade policy uncertainty 
driven by rising protectionism and retaliatory tariffs, strategic decoupling amongst

major economies and the migration of national security tools into the domain of trade 
policy. This reorientation is evident across critical sectors. Semiconductor supply 
chains are being restructured to ensure technological autonomy and independence. 
Perceptions of geopolitical risk drive the diversification of critical minerals, telecom 
infrastructure, and pharmaceutical inputs. The use of investment screening regimes to protect 
sensitive technologies and restrictions on dual-use technologies exemplify this shift. 
4.7	 Parallel to trade uncertainty is the phenomenon of geopolitical realignment. The 
Russia-Ukraine conflict, the reconfiguration of energy trade routes and the expansion 
of BRICS exemplify this realignment. Furthermore, the emergence of ‘minilateral’ 
platforms, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue and the Indo-Pacific Economic 
Framework for Prosperity, along with new connectivity corridors, including the India-
Middle East-Europe Corridor, suggests that the dynamics of global relations are 
shifting. Supply chains are increasingly evaluated not merely in terms of cost efficiency 
but based on resilience and strategic autonomy. These shifts indicate the transition 
from unfettered integration to ‘geostrategic globalisation’, a world where countries 
remain interconnected but exercise greater caution regarding whom they trade with, 
how they source inputs, and which partners they depend upon.2
4.8	 Geoeconomic factors are now critical determinants in shaping key bilateral 
trade patterns. These factors not only exert a substantial influence on trade relations 
among major economies but also affect the nature of their relationships with other 
economies.3 As shown in Chart IV.1, according to data from UNCTAD, friendshoring 
trends (trade growth between politically close countries) have consistently remained 
above the average levels seen in calendar year (CY) 2021. Notably, there has been a 
resurgence in friendshoring in CY 2025, following a slight decline observed in CY 2024. 
Nearshoring remains below its CY 2021 average; however, it improved in Q3 CY 2025, 
reflecting a slight increase in trade growth among geographically proximate countries.4,5 
In parallel, trade concentration increased in CY 2025 after declining continuously in

4 	 Friend-shoring involves increased trading with economies with politically aligned stances, and the Friendshoring 
Index is calculated as trade-weighted political proximity as measured by the United Nations’ voting patterns. The 
political closeness between an importer and its suppliers is calculated based on foreign policy similarity. Foreign 
policy similarity data is obtained from the Foreign Policy Similarity FPSIM dataset (Häge, 2017), which uses 
alliance ties (Häge, 2011) and United Nations General Assembly voting patterns (Voeten, 2013). Foreign policy 
similarity is measured as the average similarity in the voting record of each country pair, corrected for the fact 
that non-alliance ties are more frequent than alliance ties. An increase in the average political closeness of trade 
indicates a shift in the importer's import structure towards countries that share similar global views, which is 
interpreted as a trend towards friend-shoring: https://tinyurl.com/85yf6ee2.
5 	 Nearshoring measures the geographic proximity of trade relationships and shows whether countries are sourcing 
from nearby partners or distant ones.  Nearshoring Index is calculated as the reverse of the trade-weighted 
average distance in km. The average geographical distance of the imports of a node sourcing from different 
suppliers is computed using the bilateral geodesic distance between the node and each of its trading partners, 
weighted by the value of bilateral trade. A decrease in the average geodesic distance would denote a nearshoring 
trend: https://tinyurl.com/85yf6ee2.

together, these trends underscore that a more comprehensive understanding of trade 
must therefore incorporate the interdependence of economics, security, technology, 
and politics, an intersection that defines the contemporary global order.

4.9	 Since CY 2020, there has been a growing tendency to use trade policy for broader 
objectives such as environmental sustainability, industrial policy and national security. 
This trend is reflected in the Global Trade Policy Activity (GTPA) Index,8 which remained 
relatively stable from CY 2010 to CY 2020, but has experienced a significant increase 
since then. Key factors contributing to this rise include trade tensions between the US 
and China in CY 2019, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ongoing conflict in 
Eastern Europe, which began in CY 2022, and global trade tensions in CY 2025.

4.10		 Chart IV.2 depicts the trends in the GTPA Index alongside measures that facilitate 
and restrict trade. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Eastern 
Europe, trade facilitation measures increased in tandem with the implementation 
of restrictive measures. This was mainly due to countries' efforts to address shock-
induced shortages of essential goods, such as medical equipment and raw materials. 
However, the overall rise in the GTPA Index in CY 2025, amidst global trade tensions, 
mainly stems from a sharper increase in the implementation of restrictive trade policies 
compared to trade facilitation measures.

4.12		 The sources of this uncertainty are both economic and non-economic in nature. 
While industrial policies and competition for critical raw materials are driving supportive 
trade measures, persistent concerns over trade imbalances are simultaneously 
prompting corrective trade measures. Additionally, some nations are employing trade 
policy unilaterally to pursue their various domestic goals. These unilateral actions 
have, in turn, prompted retaliation. As rule-based trading systems weaken, strategic 
ambiguity is likely to characterise the trade policymaking process, further contributing 
to uncertainty.13
4.13		 While a series of trade agreements between the major economies has contributed 
to a reduction in this uncertainty, it remains elevated due to the absence of clear, 
transparent, and sustainable agreements among these partners.

4.14		 The global trade environment, as discussed above, has left a discernible imprint 
on global trade performance. The frontloading of trade orders in anticipation of higher 
tariffs has led to a significant increase in trade in CY 2025; however, this positive 
trend is constrained by ongoing fragmentation, which is seen to limit potential gains. 
Furthermore, the actual effective tariff rates14 have lagged behind the effective rate 
based on the announcements. This delay is attributed to factors such as stockpiling, 
pauses in tariffs, trade diversion and rerouting.15
4.15		 As a result, the IMF's World Economic Outlook, October 2025, projected that 
global trade volume (goods & services) will grow at an average rate of 3.6 per cent during 
CY 2025 and then decrease to 2.3 per cent in CY 2026, which is markedly lower than the 
3.5 per cent growth recorded in CY 2024. However, the trade performance of advanced 
economies (AEs) exhibits significant differences compared to that of emerging market 
and developing economies (EMDEs). Although growth forecasts for EMDEs in terms 
of trade volume for both imports and exports are expected to be higher compared to 
AEs, trade policy uncertainty is likely to have a more pronounced impact on the trade 
volumes of EMDEs than on those of AEs.

TRENDS IN INDIA’S TRADE PERFORMANCE 
4.17	 	 Over the past decades, India has significantly deepened its integration with 
global markets, underpinned by strong export performance, a resilient services trade, 
and a widening network of trade partnerships. Recent years have showcased the 
country's trade performance as a reflection of growing competitiveness, diversification, 
and adaptability to shifting global demand dynamics. Additionally, the consistent rise 
in non-petroleum merchandise exports highlights the economy’s expanding capacity 
for trade in high-value manufacturing and knowledge-intensive sectors. 
4.18		 The country’s steady rise as a key player in global trade is evident in its increasing 
share of both global merchandise exports and commercial services exports. Between 
CY 2005 and CY 2024, India’s share of global merchandise exports has nearly doubled, 
rising from 1 per cent to 1.8 per cent; similarly, its share in global commercial services 
exports has more than doubled, rising from 2 per cent to 4.3 per cent.16
4.19		 The country has not only increased its share in global trade but has also diversified 
its partnerships and the range of products it trades. According to UNCTAD’s Trade 
and Development Report 2025, India ranks third among countries in the Global South 
in terms of the diversity index of trade partnerships,17 following China and the UAE. 
India’s index score of 3.2 exceeds that of all countries in the Global North, underscoring 
its resilience in the face of tariff uncertainties and other emerging challenges. In terms 
of the merchandise trade diversity indicator,18 India ranks fourth in the Global South, 
following Thailand, China and Turkey, with an index score of 0.88. While this score 
exceeds that of several Global North nations, such as South Korea, it still falls short 
compared to the scores of the US and the EU, indicating significant opportunities for 
improvement in this area.19 
4.20		 India’s total exports (merchandise and services) have demonstrated consistent 
and significant growth in recent years, particularly following a robust recovery after 
the pandemic. Chart IV.5 shows that in FY25, the total exports amounted to USD 
825.3 billion, registering a 6.1 per cent (YoY) growth, the highest levels of exports ever 
recorded. This performance is primarily attributed to the growth of services exports, 
16 	WTO’s World Trade Statistics, https://tinyurl.com/3sxabdnr.
17 	Composite diversity index of merchandise trade partnerships captures the heterogeneity of an economy’s trading 
relationships. A higher index value indicates wider and more homogeneously distributed trade flows across 
partners, reflecting greater diversification.
18 	The merchandise trade diversity indicator is calculated based on the Shannon entropy index, which measures 	
the diversification of merchandise trade partnerships and products. The index was computed for the 63 largest 
economies in terms of aggregated exports and imports: 45 correspond to the global South, and 18 to the global 
North (the European Union is treated as a single economy). Economies with a wider range and homogeneously 
distributed export values across product categories have higher scores, indicating higher product-level trade 
diversity.

which experienced a 13.6 per cent (YoY) increase. At the same time, the country’s 
total imports also increased by 7.4 per cent (YoY) and stood at USD 919.9 billion. The 
surplus in services trade cushioned the merchandise trade deficit, and consequently, in 
FY25, the total trade deficit amounted to USD 94.7 billion. This trade pattern reflects 
the impact of stronger import demand amid an expanding economy and resilient 
consumption.

4.21		 This strong momentum has been carried forward into FY26 as both Q1 (Apr-June 
2025), Q2 (July-Sept 2025) and Q3 (Oct-Dec 2025) recorded their highest-ever export 
levels for their respective quarters, despite ongoing global uncertainties. Furthermore, 
during April-December 2025, exports totalled USD 634.3 billion, a 4.3 per cent (YoY) 
increase, whereas imports increased by 4.9 per cent (YoY) to USD 730.8 billion. During 
the same period, the trade deficit increased to USD 96.6 billion compared to USD 88.4 
billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.
Merchandise trade
4.22		 The merchandise trade performance exhibits the economy’s ability to hold ground 
amid a volatile global environment. It reaffirms its position as a reliable trading partner 
and an emerging force in global trade. Chart IV.6 depicts the trends in the country’s 
merchandise trade in recent years. In FY25, India’s merchandise exports totalled USD 
437.7 billion, maintaining similar levels to those observed in FY24. While aggregate 
merchandise export growth may appear subdued, it is imperative to acknowledge

that non-petroleum, non-gems and jewellery exports, accounting for 78.7 per cent of 
aggregate merchandise exports, exhibited a robust growth rate of 7.5 per cent (YoY) 
during the same period. Further, the non-petroleum exports reached a historic high of 
USD 374.3 billion.  This underscores the inherent strength of the export sector, which 
volatility in the exports of gems and jewellery and petroleum may obscure. Consequently, 
the perceived stagnation in total merchandise exports can largely be attributed to the 
disproportionate influence of petroleum and gems and jewellery, which often masks 
the more favourable trends present within the broader export sector. 
4.23		 In FY25, the export composition was predominantly concentrated in petroleum 
products, telecom instruments, drug formulations and biologicals. Collectively, these 
sectors account for approximately a quarter of the total exports. The exports of petroleum 
products declined by 24.7 per cent (YoY), amid softer crude oil prices, which decreased 
by 15.4 per cent (YoY).20 Exports of telecom instruments witnessed a significant growth 
of 51.2 per cent (YoY) while those of drug formulations and biologicals experienced a 
growth of 11.2 per cent (YoY). These trends are a testament to the country’s increasing 
strength in electronic manufacturing and reaffirm its position as a global pharmaceutical 
hub. Among the other principal commodities, steady gains were observed in exports 
of electric machinery and equipment, ready-made garments made from cotton, and 
motor vehicles/cars. 
4.24		 On the import side, merchandise imports increased by 6.3 per cent (YoY) in 
FY25, amounting to USD 721.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a rise in 
non-petroleum, non-gems and jewellery imports, which increased to USD 446.5 billion 
from USD 421 billion in FY24. This trend is attributed to a higher demand for critical 
intermediate inputs and capital goods, indicating a resilient domestic demand.  
4.25		 In FY25, India’s import composition continues to be dominated by petroleum 
crude, gold and petroleum products, with these sectors accounting for over one-third 
of total imports. Imports of petroleum crude increased marginally by 2.7 per cent 
(YoY) amid softer crude oil prices, reflecting stable energy demand, while gold imports 
increased by 27.4 per cent (YoY). The increase in gold imports may be attributed to a 
rise in gold prices, increasing by 38.2 per cent (YoY) and driven by strong domestic 
consumption.21 Additionally, imports of electronic components, telecom instruments 
and computer hardware also experienced significant growth.

improvement in the country’s manufacturing abilities. A rise in merchandise imports in 
conjunction with stable merchandise exports resulted in a widening of the merchandise 
trade deficit, which reached USD 283.5 billion, marking a 17.6 per cent (YoY) increase 
in FY25.

4.27		 The merchandise trade performance in FY26 so far reflects a continuation of the 
trends prevailing in FY25. During April-December 2025, merchandise exports have 
registered a growth of 2.4 per cent (YoY), while non-petroleum, non-gems and jewellery 
exports increased by 6.0 per cent (YoY), signalling sustained strength in India’s core 
export basket. This increase in exports is driven by electronics goods, which grew by 
35.1 per cent (YoY). The exports of mica, coal, and other ores and minerals, including 
processed minerals, grew by 14.7 per cent (YoY), whereas marine product exports grew 
by 15.5 per cent (YoY). 
4.28		 On the imports side, merchandise imports amounted to USD 578.6 billion, 
registering a 5.9 per cent (YoY) increase. Furthermore, non-petroleum and non-gems 
and jewellery imports witnessed a higher growth of 9.5 per cent (YoY) in the same 
period, reflecting resilient domestic demand for both consumption and production. 
This increase is attributed to an increase in imports of electronic goods (17.1 per cent 
YoY) and machinery, electrical and non-electrical (14.2 per cent YoY), which support the 
country’s manufacturing and technology sectors. Furthermore, a substantial increase 
in imports of chemical material and products (44.4 per cent) suggests steady industrial 
demand in the economy. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit widened to USD

248.3 billion in April-December 2025 from USD 224.0 billion in the corresponding 
period of the previous year. 
Performance of agricultural exports
4.29		 During FY20-FY25, India’s merchandise exports grew with a compounded 
average growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9 per cent. In comparison, agricultural exports 
increased from USD 34.5 billion in FY20 to USD 51.1 billion in FY25, registering a 
CAGR of 8.2 per cent. During the same period, the share of agricultural exports in the 
country’s merchandise exports has varied between 11 per cent and 14 per cent. However, 
between FY23 and FY25, the country’s agriculture exports have stagnated. Whereas, 
global export of agricultural products rose from USD 2.3 trillion in CY 2022 to USD 2.4 
trillion in CY 2024.22
4.30		 India is the world's second-largest agricultural producer by value.23 However, 
according to the WTO’s World Trade Statistics, the country’s share in global agricultural 
exports has increased only modestly from 1.1 per cent in 2000 to 2.2 per cent in 2024.24 
This disparity between production value and export performance highlights the 
significant untapped potential for expanding trade in agricultural products.

exports are influenced by a range of supply-side factors, including food security, 
processing facilities, infrastructure bottlenecks, and various regulations. However, given 
the volatility in domestic prices and production of certain commodities, trade policy 
has often been employed to achieve short-term domestic objectives, such as managing 
inflation through product-specific interventions, including ad hoc export bans or the 
imposition of minimum export prices. Frequent policy changes can significantly disrupt 
export supply chains, create market uncertainty and cause foreign buyers to switch to 
other sources. Export markets once lost are not easily recovered. 
4.32		 Although these measures may temporarily stabilise domestic prices, they risk 
longer-term reputational costs, particularly as India is widely regarded as a source of 
high-quality agricultural products. Therefore, measures such as subsidised distribution 
of essential food items via the public distribution system, managing buffer stocks 
and intervening in the market via an open market sale scheme, using the Essential 
Commodities Act, 1955 to prevent hoarding and speculation, and deploying the price 
stabilisation fund to convert buffer stock for retail sale are the policy options available 
to ensure availability of agricultural products at fair prices for the domestic market.  It 
is possible to stabilise domestic availability and prices while enabling farmers to tap 
global markets for better incomes. 
4.33		 By maintaining a delicate balance between fulfilling domestic demand and 
harnessing its export potential, India’s remarkable achievements in agricultural 
production can translate into export-led growth, enabling the country to achieve its goal 
of USD 100 billion in agricultural exports. Exports also make farmers more productive 
and competitive by fostering knowledge accumulation and market feedback.
4.34		 As an aspirational economy, India will see its imports rise steadily. That is the 
global experience over centuries. India must explore all opportunities to increase 
its export earnings to pay for the import needs of a growing economy. Agricultural 
exports are a low-hanging fruit with immense export potential. Importantly, they 
carry international leverage for India. Policies, therefore, must be aligned with this 
imperative.
Trade Performance of Production-Linked Incentive Scheme Sectors 
4.35		 The PLI scheme was introduced in April 2020 to enhance domestic manufacturing 
and promote exports. Initially, it encompassed sectors such as mobile manufacturing, 
specific electronic components, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and medical 
devices. However, as the scheme evolved, it expanded to encompass a total of 14 sectors, 
reflecting a strategic approach to enhancing India's manufacturing capabilities. 
4.36		 A notable outcome of the PLI initiative has been the remarkable trade performance 
of these sectors. During the period FY21-FY25, the average annual growth rate (AAGR) 

Economic Survey 2025-26

of exports from this sector stands at 10.6 per cent, while imports have experienced an 
AAGR of 12.6 per cent. 
4.37		 However, there exists a variation in the trade performance within these sectors. 
A few sectors recorded high export growth (with their AAGR exceeding 20 per cent, on 
average, during FY21-FY25). These include IT hardware (77.2 per cent), ACC batteries 
(45.0 per cent), electronics (38.8 per cent), solar PV (23.9 per cent), and speciality 
steel (22.5 per cent). This export expansion has generally been accompanied by an 
increase (AAGR) in imports that has been moderate in electronics (17.6 per cent), IT 
hardware (11 per cent) and speciality steel (17.5 per cent), but substantially higher in 
solar PV (155.4 per cent) and ACC batteries (24.9 per cent). These trends indicate a 
scaling up of production capacity and the integration of value chains, suggesting that 
domestic manufacturing is not only maturing but is also beginning to leverage imported 
intermediate goods to facilitate higher-value exports.

4.38		 In contrast, certain sectors demonstrated moderate export growth (with their 
AAGR below 20 per cent), which include automobiles (14.1 per cent), textiles (7.8 per

positive import growth (AAGR), for instance, automobiles (15.1 per cent), textiles (13.2

expansion of domestic activity alongside continued reliance on imported inputs and 
technology.

4.39		 In particular, the telecom sector has achieved notable success, with exports 
rising by 1.5 per cent (AAGR) while imports have concurrently declined by 18.5 per cent 
(AAGR). This trend indicates an early accomplishment in import substitution, aligning 
with the PLI framework's overarching objective of enhancing market penetration 
abroad. Collectively, these developments illustrate the success of the PLI scheme in 
boosting the country’s export growth.
Diversification of India’s export destinations and import sources 
4.40		 India is currently subject to an effective export tariff rate of 50 per cent on goods 
exported to the US, and this rate is among the highest imposed on any country.26 There 
has been progress in the negotiations of the trade deal between the two countries.27 
While there has been some specific impact of the tariffs, Chart IV.9 illustrates the 
resilience of India’s overall exports in some labour-intensive and small-scale sectors, 
primarily attributed to diversification towards alternative destinations. This is evident 
in the chart, which shows a YoY decline in exports to the US during the period April-
November 2025 (indicated by the green triangle). In contrast, India’s exports to the 
world have shown positive growth (YoY) (indicated by the yellow dots). These trends of 
diversification are presented in Table IV.1.

4.41	 A notable increase in the diversity of countries from which India imports crude 
oil has been observed. In FY26 (April-November), crude oil imports from Libya, Egypt, 
Brazil, the US and Brunei increased significantly compared to the same period in FY25, 
while those from Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Venezuela declined. 
4.42		 Although imports from other countries account for a significant portion of India's 
crude oil imports, the shares of the US, Egypt, UAE, Nigeria and Libya have increased. 
Between April-November 2025, the share of imports from the US increased to 8.1 per 
cent from 4.6 per cent in the same period in FY25, while UAE’s share increased to 11.1 
per cent from 9.4 per cent, Egypt’s share increased to 1.4 per cent from 0.3 per cent, 
Nigeria's share increased to 3.3 per cent from 2.2 per cent and Libya’s share increased 
to 0.5 per cent from 0.1 per cent.
4.43		 The foregoing section discusses the country’s resilient and robust merchandise 
trade performance. Nevertheless, these outcomes also point to a larger opportunity: 
sustaining export momentum will require diversification towards higher-value, more 
sophisticated products and new destinations. 
4.44		 While the export performance of the PLI sectors indicates an improvement in the 
country's domestic manufacturing capabilities, a broader assessment of India's export 
basket’s composition and diversification reveals further potential for improvement. 
In 2023, India ranks 44th out of 145 countries on the Economic Complexity Index 
(ECI)35,36 as measured by the Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity.37,38 Although 
this represents an improvement from India's 57th position in CY 2013, its ranking 
has remained unchanged since CY 2019. This can be attributed to India's export 
composition, which remains concentrated on goods such as refined petroleum, 
diamonds, jewellery, packaged medicines, and rice, and much of the country’s export 
35 Economic complexity is a measure of the knowledge in a society as expressed in the products it makes. The 
economic complexity of a country is calculated based on the diversity of exports a country produces and their 
ubiquity, or the number of countries able to produce them (and those countries’ economic complexity). Countries 
that are able to sustain a diverse range of productive know-how, including sophisticated, unique know-how, are 
found to be able to produce a wide diversity of goods, including complex products that few other countries can 
make.
36 Ranking of the Export Complexity Index - A rank of countries based on how diversified and complex their export 
basket is. Countries that are home to a great diversity of productive know-how, particularly complex, specialised 
know-how, are able to produce a great diversity of sophisticated products. The complexity of a country’s exports 
is found to highly predict current income levels, or where complexity exceeds expectations for a country’s income 
level, the country is predicted to experience more rapid growth in the future. ECI therefore provides a useful 
measure of economic development.

growth comes from products that fall into low- and mid-complexity categories.39,40 The 
dominance of mid-tech and low-complexity goods underscores the imperative for India 
to pursue a significant structural shift towards high-complexity categories, including 
advanced machinery, precision engineering goods, electronics, chemicals, and high-
value services.41
4.45		 The country's underutilised productive capabilities are revealed through the gap 
between its relatively modest ECI ranking and its second rank globally on the Economic 
Complexity Outlook Index (COI),42 which evaluates future potential to diversify into 
more sophisticated products based on existing capabilities.43 Many high-complexity 
products are within India's current ability limits, implying that targeted industrial 
policies, technological improvements, and export-driven ecosystem development 
could yield significant benefits. Realising this potential, however, requires a strong 
and competitive domestic manufacturing ecosystem. To fulfil the potential indicated 
by the country's COI ranking, the domestic manufacturing ecosystem needs to be 
further scaled up, product quality to be consistently maintained at scale, and a robust 
innovation, research and development ecosystem established.
4.46		 In this direction, the government has introduced initiatives such as the 
Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) and the Research, Development 
& Innovation Fund (RDIF), complemented by initiatives such as Make in India and 
the PLI schemes. Collectively, these initiatives aim to strengthen India's research 
ecosystem, expand its innovation capacity, and enhance its technological depth, as 
discussed in Chapter 8 of this Survey. 
4.47		 Beyond strengthening R&D and innovation, realising India’s manufacturing and 
GVC potential also requires streamlining cross-border operating rules that materially

41 The Product Complexity Index (PCI) ranks the diversity and sophistication of the productive know-how required 
to produce a product. PCI is calculated based on how many other countries can produce the product and the 
economic complexity of those countries. In effect, PCI captures the amount and sophistication of know-how 
required to produce a product. Economic complexity is a measure of the knowledge in a society, as expressed in 
the products it produces. The most complex products (that only a few countries with a high economic complexity 
can produce) include sophisticated machinery, electronics and chemicals, as compared to the least complex 
products (that nearly all countries, including the ones with low economic complexity can produce), including raw 
materials and simple agricultural products. Specialised machinery is said to be complex as it requires a range 
of know-how in manufacturing, including the coordination of a range of highly skilled individuals’ know-how.
42 The Economic Complexity Outlook Index (COI) is a measure of how many complex products are near a country’s 
current set of productive capabilities. The COI captures the ease of diversification for a country, where a high COI 
reflects an abundance of nearby complex products that rely on similar capabilities or know-how as that present in

affect transaction costs and investor certainty. India’s manufacturing-led growth 
strategy and deeper participation in GVC underscore the need for closer coordination 
between transfer pricing (under income-tax law) and customs valuation (under 
customs law) in respect of related-party imports. While transfer pricing provisions 
are designed to prevent over-pricing of imports and customs valuation rules address 
under-invoicing, both frameworks are anchored in the arm’s length principle. They are 
aligned with internationally accepted standards, including those of the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Customs Organisation.
4.48		 Currently, identical import transactions are often examined separately by income 
tax and customs authorities, resulting in duplication of compliance, higher transaction 
costs, and the risk of inconsistent outcomes for the industry. Given the conceptual 
similarities in valuation methods under the two regimes, there is a clear opportunity to 
move towards a collaborative convergence approach.
4.49		 A 
structured 
framework 
enabling 
aligned 
methodologies, 
converged 
documentation by taxpayers, and coordinated administrative review can ensure greater 
certainty and predictability of tax outcomes for businesses while safeguarding revenue 
interests. Such convergence would reduce compliance burden, minimise disputes, 
enhance transparency in cross-border trade, and improve ease of doing business, 
thereby strengthening India’s attractiveness as a global manufacturing and investment 
destination.
4.50		 The global economic landscape is becoming increasingly unpredictable, driven 
by tariff increases, supply chain adjustments, and higher regulatory hurdles. For Indian 
industries, the current wave of U.S. tariff implementations and stricter non-tariff 
barriers presents a significant challenge, particularly for export-oriented sectors. The 
experience of India’s pharmaceutical industry during the shift to the WTO’s Agreement 
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is one of the most 
important moments of structural adjustment undertaken by an Indian industry in 
the post-reform era. Box IV.1 presents a case study of the pharmaceutical sector as 
an example of how the industry can reinvent itself in the face of global challenges and 
progress. The lessons are particularly relevant in the present times of increasing trade 
uncertainties and protectionist trends. 
Box IV.1:  Pharmaceutical sector’s transformation in the aftermath 
of TRIPS Agreement: Lessons for India Inc.
The pharmaceutical sector, which had expanded under the process-patent regime of the 1970 
Patent Act, faced a sudden change in its operating environment when the TRIPS-compliant 
product-patent regime took effect in CY 1995. This shift challenged the very foundation of 
India’s competitive advantage, reverse engineering, and cost-efficient process innovation.44

However, the manner in which the sector responded offers a compelling template for 
industries currently confronting rising external trade barriers, especially tariff escalations 
in major markets. The episode underscores how an external shock can catalyse capability 
creation, market repositioning, and long-term global competitiveness when firms undertake 
strategic upgrading.
Nature of the TRIPS shock
The process-patent regime enabled Indian firms to legally replicate patented drugs by 
developing alternative production pathways, thereby creating one of the most affordable 
pharmaceutical ecosystems in the world. TRIPS, however, mandated a 20-year product-
patent regime,45 eliminating this legal flexibility. This could be characterised as a “deep 
institutional disruption.” Firms faced a loss of freedom to reverse-engineer patented 
molecules, escalating costs due to regulatory, documentation, and clinical requirements, 
along with higher entry barriers that favoured IP-rich multinational firms.
This shift sparked fears of sectoral contraction. However, rather than shrinking, the sector 
leveraged the disruption to develop deeper capabilities, expand into new markets, and 
strengthen its integration with GVCs. 
Industry Response
Rewiring Internal Capabilities: The earliest and most important response to the TRIPS 
shock was a clear shift toward developing internal capabilities. Indian pharmaceutical 
companies moved beyond simple process improvements. They began investing heavily in 
formulation science, transitioning R&D from reverse-engineering existing drugs to creating 
New Chemical Entities, cost-efficient Novel Drug Delivery Systems, and complex generics 
that meet global regulatory standards.46 Industry-wide R&D spending grew from ₹ 1250 
million in FY94 to nearly ₹209.8 billion by FY19.47,48,49
This 
expanded 
scientific 
and 
technological 
foundation 
fostered 
innovation-led 
competitiveness. By strengthening internal capabilities early on, Indian firms positioned
45 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. In agreement on trade-related aspects of 
intellectual property rights (pp. 319–322): Article 27 of the TRIPS agreement mandated patents to be granted for 
any invention, including product & process, in all fields of technology, that involved an inventive step and was 
capable of industrial use. This protection was to be granted for a minimum of 20 years as per Article 33 of the 
same agreement: https://tinyurl.com/4bv2c7ac.  Owing to these provisions, which India signed up for following 
its entry into the WTO and consequently the TRIPS agreement, Article 5 of the Patents Act, 1970, which allowed 
patents for the process of manufacture, was amended in 2005 to permit only product patents. This curtailed the 
pharmaceutical industry from producing generic medicines for patented drugs, without giving them royalties:

themselves to enter and grow in regulated export markets. This is a strategic lesson for 
modern sectors now facing tariff-driven external shocks: competitiveness must be developed 
before it is demanded.
Market Diversification as a Structural Hedge: A second primary strategic response 
was rapid market diversification. As TRIPS-era constraints narrowed domestic opportunities, 
Indian pharmaceutical firms pivoted outward, targeting regulated markets such as the US 
and Europe by filing large-scale Drug Master Files (DMFs)50 for APIs and Abbreviated New 
Drug Applications51 for generics. India’s global share of DMF filings rose sharply from 14.5 
per cent in CY 2000 to 48.7 per cent by CY 2007, with 331 active DMF filings by India in 
2019.52 These filings helped the pharmaceutical industry penetrate these markets despite 
the restrictions of the TRIPS agreement. This demonstrated a core structural insight: over-
reliance on a single market magnifies vulnerability, while multi-market exposure insulates 
firms from tariff shocks.
Collaborative and Risk-Sharing Innovation Models: Indian companies adopted innovation 
models suited to a patent-heavy environment. Out-licensing, which enabled firms to develop 
molecules during early stages and then partner with multinationals, generated milestone-
based revenue while lowering R&D risk. In parallel, India’s emergence as a global hub for 
Contract Research and Manufacturing Services (CRAMS) is attributed to the country’s 
strong scientific talent and production costs that are 30-40 per cent lower than those of other 
nations. As a result, India entered the global CRAMS market, valued at USD 532.10 million 
in CY 2005, and is expected to grow to USD 90.4 billion by CY 2030.53,54  These collaborative 
models embedded Indian firms deeper within global pharmaceutical value chains.
Strategic M&A for Global Integration: Recognising the need for distribution access 
and regulatory footholds, Indian firms undertook targeted acquisitions abroad. These moves 
enabled a local presence in developed markets, improved compliance, and accelerated the 
adoption of technology. M&A became a channel to bypass tariff or regulatory frictions and 
integrate vertically into global markets.
From Disruption to Leadership: By the early 2010s, India had become the world’s 
largest supplier of affordable generics, responsible for nearly 20 per cent of global supply.55

Export markets diversified, regulatory credibility deepened, and the innovation pipeline 
expanded. What began as an existential threat evolved into a catalyst for global leadership. 
This strategic realignment translated into a substantial expansion of India’s pharmaceutical 
exports. Between FY01 and FY25, pharmaceutical exports increased from USD 1.9 billion to 
USD 30.5 billion in FY25, representing a nearly 16-fold rise driven by market diversification, 
regulatory alignment, and enhancements in capability.56,57
Lessons for India Inc. in today’s tariff environment: Regulatory capacity, diversified 
markets, and upgraded capabilities transformed a vulnerable sector into a global powerhouse. 
Rather than being diminished by TRIPS, the sector repositioned itself at the higher end 
of the pharmaceutical value chain. This sector’s rebound from the TRIPS crisis is a clear 
demonstration of how external shocks can be turned into opportunities through strategic 
action. In the current situation of an unpredictable global tariff regime, India Inc. can draw 
inspiration from the pharmaceutical sector to capitalise on this situation to its advantage. 
India Inc. must focus on capability building through strong R&D, Market diversification 
to reduce dependence on a single market and build resilience, and partnership-driven 
models such as co-development, licensing, and contract manufacturing to help reduce risk. 
Additionally, strategic consolidation is necessary to expand in capital- and compliance-
heavy environments.
4.51		 To sustain the momentum in India’s trade performance amidst global 
uncertainty, the country is actively pursuing a diversified trade strategy. This includes 
the recently concluded India-UK Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement 
(CETA) and the India-Oman Comprehensive Economic and Partnership Agreement 
(CEPA), as well as engagements in free-trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with the 
US, Chile, and Peru. The negotiations of an FTA with New Zealand were concluded 
in December 2025.58 Furthermore, the India-Oman CEPA, signed on 18 December 
2025, provides the country with market access for goods and services in the Middle 
East and Africa. The agreement facilitates duty-free access for 99.38 per cent of India’s 
exports, with the immediate elimination of tariffs on 97.96 per cent of tariff lines. 
This includes comprehensive tariff elimination for all major labour-intensive sectors 
in India. Additionally, India has offered tariff liberalisation on 94.81 per cent of its 
imports from Oman. The service sector is also poised to benefit significantly, as the 
agreement establishes an enhanced mobility framework for Indian professionals. Oman 
has made substantial commitments across a wide range of sectors, including computer-
related services, business and professional services, audio-visual services, research and 
development, education, and health services.59

4.52	 	 An expanding network of FTAs supports India's trade strategy by offering reliable 
market access amid global uncertainty. These agreements enable export-focused firms 
to boost production and become more integrated into GVC. Furthermore, by exposing 
firms to international competition, FTAs improve export competitiveness, encouraging 
firms to prioritise productivity and reliability over reliance on access-based benefits. 
In this context, enhancements in export competitiveness increasingly depend on 
state-level implementation, as states play a vital role in providing the infrastructure, 
regulatory certainty, and administrative coordination that export-focused firms need.
4.53		 To enable the exporters to leverage the benefits of FTAs and preferential trade 
agreements, the tariff explorer service on the Trade Connect ePlatform provides 
information on tariff concessions available to eligible exports from the country. 
Furthermore, the Export Promotion Mission (EPM) establishes a comprehensive, 
flexible, and digitally driven framework for enhancing export initiatives. This approach 
signifies a strategic transition from numerous fragmented schemes to a unified, outcome-
oriented mechanism capable of promptly responding to global trade challenges and 
the evolving needs of exporters.60 The government has also implemented the Credit 
Guarantee Scheme for Exporters to provide additional financial assistance to Indian 
exporters during periods of uncertainty, thereby ensuring liquidity, promoting business 
continuity, and creating opportunities to expand into new markets. 61
4.54		 The EPM’s effectiveness is further reinforced by complementary steps 
announced by the Reserve Bank of India that aim at mitigating debt-servicing stress 
and promoting the continuity of viable export-oriented businesses. These include a 
moratorium/deferment on payments of all instalments (principal and/or interest) for 
eligible borrowers to be extended by the regulated entities (RE), an extension of tenor 
for export credit by an eligible RE for a period of up to 450 days for pre-shipment 
and post-shipment export credit disbursed till 31 March 2026. To maintain liquidity, 
REs may recalculate their drawing power by reducing margins or reassessing working 
capital limits. Under the Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods and Services) 
(Second Amendment) Regulations, 2025, the period for realisation and repatriation of 
export proceeds has been extended from nine months to 15 months, and the shipment 
period against advance payments has been increased from one year to three years.62
4.55		 Together, these regulatory and fiscal measures provide an integrated framework 
of support to exporters, maintaining liquidity, protecting credit discipline and aligning 
with the EPM’s goal of an enhanced export ecosystem.

Services trade 
4.56		 India's services trade plays a crucial role in enhancing the country's overall 
trade performance. This sector has shown resilience amid global economic volatility, as 
evidenced by its consistent growth in exports. 
4.57		 In FY25, services exports reached an all-time high of USD 387.5 billion, 
registering a robust 13.6 per cent (YoY) growth and reinforcing India’s position as 
a global hub for technology, business, and professional services. At the same time, 
services imports registered a growth of 11.4 per cent (YoY) and amounted to USD 
198.7 billion. The growth in imports is indicative of growing cross-border demand for 
business and financial services. As a result, in FY25, the services trade surplus increased 
to USD 188.8 billion, reaching the highest level ever recorded. Effectively, the surplus 
in services trade covered two-thirds of the merchandise trade deficit.

BPM, consulting, and fintech sectors. Software services exports have historically been 
the largest part of the country's overall service exports, with business services exports 
increasing recently (Chart IV.11). This growth is due to the country’s success as a global

India’s transactions with the rest of the world, capturing developments in the current 
account and capital account and offering a comprehensive view of the economy’s 
external sector.
Developments in the current account 
4.61		 India’s current account structure reflects a merchandise trade deficit offset by 
strong net inflows of invisibles, led by rising surpluses in services and private transfers 
(Chart IV.12). The services surplus has expanded steadily, driven by India’s growing 
role in global IT, business, and professional services. Remittance inflows have also 
increased consistently, providing a stable, counter-cyclical buffer. These components 
have collectively kept the current account deficit (CAD) within manageable levels. In 
H1 FY26, the CAD moderated to USD 15 billion (0.8 per cent of GDP) from USD 25.3 
billion (1.3 per cent of GDP) in H1 FY25.

Remittances 
4.63		 Private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed 
overseas, remained a key source of external-sector strength in FY26. Remittances 
increased to USD 73 billion in H1 FY26, up from USD 64.7 billion in the same period 
the previous year.70
4.64		 This near-term performance is consistent with India’s longer-term position 
as the world’s largest recipient of remittances. The latest available data indicate that 
remittance inflows increased steadily from USD 55.6 billion in FY11 to USD 135.4 
billion (provisional) in FY25, accounting for approximately 3.5 per cent of GDP in FY25 
(provisional). Correspondingly, net transfers71 have financed a substantial portion 
of the merchandise trade deficit during this period. Furthermore, in most years, 
remittances (private transfer receipts) have surpassed gross FDI inflows, highlighting 
their importance as a dependable source of external funding (Chart IV.14).

Note: As reported in the RBI’s BoP statistics, net transfers are calculated as transfer receipts (credits) minus 
transfer payments (debits). Private transfer inflows refer to private transfer receipts (credits) and primarily 
consist of remittances sent by Indians employed overseas.
4.65		  Against this backdrop of sustained and rising remittance inflows, the RBI’s 
sixth round of the Survey on Remittances for FY24 reveals notable shifts in remittance 
composition, geography and mode of remittance. While Gulf Cooperation Council 
countries have historically dominated India’s inward remittances, AEs now contribute 
more, indicating a shift towards skilled and professional workers. The US is the top 
contributor with 27.7 per cent, followed by the UAE (19.2 per cent), the UK (10.8 per 
cent), and Singapore (6.6 per cent).
Capital account development 
4.66		 The capital account records how India interacts with global financial markets 
through cross-border investments, external borrowings and other capital transactions 
and is central to understanding how the economy finances its current account needs. 
Developments in this account also signal the degree of confidence global investors place 
in India’s growth outlook, as countries with stronger macro fundamentals typically 
attract more stable and longer-term capital. In recent years, India’s capital account 
dynamics have been shaped by a combination of resilient FDI inflows, periodic swings 
in portfolio investment and shifts in external commercial borrowing in response to 
global interest-rate cycles.

2024 and into the first half of CY 2025, extending the weakness that has characterised 
international investment flows in recent years.72 According to the latest UNCTAD’s 
World Investment Report 2025, global FDI inflows declined by 11 per cent (YoY) in CY 
2024, marking the second consecutive year of contraction (excluding European conduit 
economies).73  The downturn was driven by a 58 per cent fall in FDI to Europe and a 29 
per cent decline in China.

4.68		 Despite tighter financing conditions and heightened geopolitical uncertainty, 
FDI inflows to developing economies remained broadly stable at USD 867 billion (57 
per cent of global FDI) in CY 2024. Asia continued to be the largest recipient region, 
although it recorded a modest 3 per cent decline in inflows in CY 2024.
4.69		 Preliminary data for H1 2025 shows a further 3 per cent decline in global FDI 
inflows compared to H1 2024. Net cross-border mergers and acquisitions, which 
generally reflect immediate shifts in corporate strategy, dropped sharply by 23 per 
cent, while the number of greenfield project announcements, an indicator of new 
capacity creation, decreased by 17 per cent in the same period in H1 2025 compared 
with H1 2024. However, the overall picture is not uniformly negative. The total value 
of greenfield announcements increased by 7 per cent in H1 2025, driven by significant 
investments in the digital and AI-related sectors. This dichotomy between the number 
and value of projects was due to large-scale announcements in semiconductors and

73 FDI flows are inflated by volatile flows through conduit economies. Excluding those, FDI flows fell by 11 per cent 
in CY 2024. Several European economies, including Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, 
where FDI statistics are significantly affected by conduit financial flows, reported large fluctuations and negative 
numbers in 2023 and 2024. Fewer negative numbers in 2024 exerted a net positive effect on global flows of about 
USD 230 billion.

data centres in developed countries,74 underscoring the increasing concentration of 
global capital in technology-intensive sectors.75
4.70		 International project finance, which is central to infrastructure investment in 
developing economies, also experienced a contraction, with its total value declining by 
8 per cent in H1 2025, continuing the downward trajectory observed in CY 2023 and CY 
2024. This weakness was more pronounced in renewable energy and power, reflecting 
the impact of higher global interest rates that have raised the cost of capital for long-
gestation projects.
4.71	 	 FDI inflows to developed countries (excluding European conduit economies) 
declined by 7 per cent in the H1 of 2025. The number of greenfield project announcements 
in these nations fell by 20 per cent over the same period, primarily driven by decreases in 
manufacturing sectors reliant on supply chains. The US remained a notable exception, 
supported by substantial commitments in the AI and semiconductor sectors. Taken 
together, these trends indicate a shift in global investment flows away from capital-
intensive, long-gestation infrastructure projects towards shorter-cycle, technology-
driven investments. 
Trends in investment flows into India
4.72		 Cross-border financial flows, which include flows in securities (e.g., stocks and 
bonds) and in FDI, are an important mechanism of India’s integration with global 
capital markets. India has consistently attracted sizeable gross investment inflows, 
amounting to 18.5 per cent of GDP in FY25 and 16.9 per cent in H1 FY26, even amid 
tightening global financial conditions.76
4.73		 According to UNCTAD data, while India recorded a marginal decline of 2 per cent 
in FDI inflows in CY 2024, it remained the largest recipient of gross inflows in South 
Asia and surpassed major Asian peers such as Indonesia and Vietnam. The decline was 
relatively modest when viewed against the sharp contractions experienced by several 
large emerging markets.
4.74		 This resilience is also evident in greenfield investment activity, which provides 
a forward-looking signal of global investor sentiment. India ranked fourth globally 
in CY 2024, with 1,080 announced greenfield projects, and has emerged as the 
largest destination for greenfield digital investments between CY 2020 and CY 2024, 
74 The number of greenfield announcements fell by 12 per cent, while the total project value dropped by 37 per cent 
in developing countries.

attracting USD 114 billion. This is well ahead of Malaysia (USD 74 billion), Singapore 
(USD 39 billion), Vietnam (USD 32 billion), Mexico (USD 29 billion), and China (USD 
24 billion).77 Notably, India attracted investments across various categories, including 
digital services, data centres, and IT infrastructure.
4.75		 According to RBI data, in FY25, gross FDI inflows into India stood at USD 81.0 
billion, representing a 13 per cent increase from USD 71.3 billion in FY2478. Of these 
gross FDI inflows, equity inflows accounted for USD 51 billion, and approximately 60 
per cent of these flows were directed towards services, computer software and hardware, 
trading, non-conventional energy, construction, and the automobile sector.79
4.76		 In April-November 2025, gross FDI inflows strengthened further to USD 64.7 
billion, compared with USD 55.8 billion in April-November 2024. The magnitude 
of inflows during the first eight months of the year highlights sustained investor 
confidence despite a subdued global environment and reflects the underlying strength 
of India’s digital economy, as well as the continued policy emphasis on manufacturing 
and infrastructure.

4.77		 FDI outflows from India increased to USD 22.1 billion during April-November 
2025. Despite this, improvements in gross inflows along with a moderation in profit 
repatriation by foreign investors led to a strengthening of net FDI. Net FDI increased 
nearly sevenfold to USD 5.6 billion during April-November 2025, up from USD 0.8 
billion in the same period a year earlier. 
4.78		 It is important to examine the return on inward FDI, while there is a recent 
slowdown in net FDI, which would indicate the profitability of the investments. Box 
IV.2 presents evidence on India’s inward FDI returns, providing a useful complement 
to the analysis of gross and net inflows.
Box IV.2: Returns on inward Foreign Direct Investment
Returns on inward FDI are estimated as FDI equity income receipts expressed as a percentage 
of the total inward FDI stock.80 This indicator provides information on the profitability 
of direct investment enterprises. For example, when the rate of return on inward FDI 
increases, it implies that resident direct investment enterprises are more profitable and 
more competitive for investors. 
To account for the lag between investment and income generation, the inward FDI stock is 
measured with a two-year lag, recognising that returns typically materialise after an initial 
gestation period. This is particularly relevant given the multi-year gestation periods typical 
of investments in manufacturing, infrastructure and digital services. Accordingly, annual 
returns on inward FDI are computed as:
 Direct Investment Incomet 
Inward FDI Stockt-2
FDI Returnt =
Using this approach, CareEdge analysis81 for 2014-2023 shows that India’s average return 
on inward FDI is approximately 7.3 per cent, higher than that of some major emerging 
economies, such as Thailand (7 per cent), Brazil (6.1 per cent), Mexico (4.3 per cent), and 
South Africa (4.3 per cent). It is also higher than that of some AEs, such as France (3.6 per 
cent), Germany (3.0 per cent), the US (2.9 per cent), and the UK (2.2 per cent). 
This analysis is further extended to compute the risk-adjusted return, defined as the 
ratio of the 10-year average return to its standard deviation. India ranks second only 
to Indonesia among the major economies examined, with a ratio above 7, compared 
with around 5 or lower for several large AEs. This combination of higher returns 
and comparatively low volatility underscores India’s positioning as a destination 
offering reasonable yield without exposing investors to extreme earnings swings. 
The average FDI returns in India remain attractive.

4.79		 Net FDI, which has traditionally been driven by fluctuations in gross inflows, 
has also reflected the impact of repatriation and Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) 
by Indian firms in recent times. While these outflows mechanically reduce net FDI, 
they align with the growing internationalisation of Indian enterprises as they expand 
their business presence abroad, enabling them to compete in the global market and 
strengthening the Indian economy in the long term. Furthermore, the rising trend of 
repatriation suggests that India is not only attracting foreign capital but also delivering 
strong returns, which enhances its reputation as a reliable investment destination.
4.80		 Going forward, the challenge is to sustain FDI inflows in an environment of 
heightened global volatility, which underscores the need for a multi-pronged strategy 
that strengthens the investment climate by addressing both structural and cyclical 
factors that determine capital flows. Box IV.3 discusses this challenge and suggests a 
way forward. 
Box IV.3: India’s FDI Challenge: Turning success into sustainable growth
EMDEs, including Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Morocco, and Vietnam, have effectively 
leveraged the trade and investment reorientation strategies employed by China and the US. 
By positioning themselves as connector countries,82 these nations have reaped the benefits 
of FDI, driven by tariff avoidance and the intent to serve as export platforms. Connector 
countries serve as a base for multinational enterprises that establish production in the host

country primarily to export goods or services to other markets, rather than mainly catering 
to the domestic market.83
Countries have also been attracting FDI through a mix of policies and incentives, with the 
latter being used to stimulate investments in strategic sectors. For example, Vietnam has 
been able to attract greater FDI by leveraging corporate tax rate reductions for investors, well-
developed industrial zones, and a deep network of FTAs. Its geographic proximity to East 
Asia’s top emerging economies and business-friendly policies make it a preferable host for 
investments.84  Vietnam has introduced a policy to accelerate investment project approvals, 
“Decree 19”, which establishes a special investment procedure that drastically streamlines 
the investment licensing process, aiming to attract high-quality capital, particularly in high-
tech industries.85 To attract investment into strategic sectors like artificial intelligence and 
semiconductors, Vietnam, Brazil, and Chile have been incentivising investment in research 
and development centres.86 
Malaysia undertook the facilitation route to attract investments by launching a ‘Golden Pass’ 
scheme to attract unicorn start-ups and venture capitalists, streamlining visa, employment, 
and licensing procedures.87 Similarly, the Philippines has enacted the ‘Create More Act’, 
which empowers the Investment Promotion Agency to issue special visas to foreign nationals 
possessing highly specialised skills or occupying executive roles. These efforts collectively 
contribute to the favourable investment climate in these regions.88 
Another model through which many countries have successfully attracted foreign investment 
involves the establishment of structures headed by higher levels of government. Some 
examples are detailed in the table below.89:

A common thread running across these senior empowered structures is their authority to 
negotiate investment deals using incentives. India’s task to attract FDI is even more complex, 
as it is not just competing with the world's current largest exporter for shifting GVCs to 
India, but also with emerging FDI destinations (as per the Table above), which have already 
been wooing investors with interventions at the PM level. 
India has what it takes to attract FDI, given that institutions like Invest India are already 
in place. However, the integration of efforts, culminating in a structure led by the highest 
levels of the government with robust Centre-State coordination, is what would make large 
investors believe in our intention to host them. Furthermore, a strategic approach to 
identifying priority sectors, along with a mix of incentives and reforms, will help prevent the 
dilution of policy efforts and improve overall effectiveness.
Challenges and way forward
Global surveys show that political stability and strong macroeconomic fundamentals are 
key drivers of FDI. India excels in this area but could better leverage its strengths. Despite 
a clear government intent and proven economic management, FDI inflows remain below 
their potential, especially for infrastructure needs. Proactive reforms are essential to attract 
more foreign investment. 
This approach involves developing a targeted strategy that identifies a specific set of GVC 
anchors and establishes a state apparatus that collaborates directly with them as partners. 
The direct engagement will help resolve cross-agency issues and provide customised and 
time-bound solutions. Additionally, it is crucial for India not only to offer compelling 
incentives but also to ensure these incentives are reliably implemented. This strategy will

Economic Survey 2025-26

182
help mitigate execution risks for involved firms, fostering a more stable and attractive 
investment environment. Establishing a single, empowered centre of accountability will 
position India as a credible alternative production hub capable of handling large volumes, 
integrating with global suppliers, meeting regulatory and compliance standards, and, 
importantly, providing predictability over a multi-year timeframe.
Creating a task force to engage top global companies and promote India’s advantages - 
stability, macroeconomic strength, sustained growth and market size - could boost FDI, 
especially in targeted sectors. Proactive diplomacy, highlighting these strengths, can help 
offset tariff challenges. 
Efforts to improve the investment environment by simplifying processes and procedures 
to attract FDI will need to be kept up.90 As foreign investors prioritise predictability and 
sustainability in policies, every policy change in the country must pass the necessity test to 
meet both these parameters. 
Further enhancements are required on the regulatory environment front, as well as 
improvements in logistics and workforce development. The World Bank’s Logistics 
Performance Index, for example, placed India at 38th position in 2023.91 While on the one 
hand, these gaps indicate how far India is from achieving the world’s best in terms of logistics, 
they also open doors to vast improvement opportunities that could yield substantial returns 
in terms of FDI.
The momentum created by improvements in the investment climate, streamlined regulations, 
and reduced bureaucratic procedures, thereby enhancing the ease of doing business, must 
be sustained and accelerated. India’s credit rating upgrades can be leveraged for additional 
momentum, as foreign investment and sovereign ratings demonstrate a strong historical 
correlation globally. India's continued economic resilience, steadfast commitment to fiscal 
consolidation, and reform trajectory position it well for unlocking investor interest.
On bilateral initiatives, the signing of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between India and 
Israel, along with the binding commitment of USD 100 billion in investment under the India-
European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement 
(TEPA), bodes well for India’s FDI inflows, provided these agreements are effectively 
implemented. This along with the signing of the India-UK Comprehensive Economic and 
Trade Agreement, have the potential to increase FDI inflows.92 While it is essential to 
recognise the role of trade and investment agreements as enablers, there is a pressing need 
for action across departments and agencies to streamline India’s trade policy and secure a 
greater role in GVCs.
Companies harvest profits from established operations in India while hesitating to commit 
fresh capital amid global uncertainty. The solution lies in mobilising new investment 
through policy stability, aggressive investor engagement, and scaling proven state-level 
models nationwide.

India's fundamentals, such as strong growth, expanding markets, and a demographic 
dividend, remain compelling magnets for investment, yet FDI strategies must become 
bolder and offer the best to global investors. The window for action is still open, but it will 
not remain so indefinitely. There is a need to move decisively to transform the FDI challenge 
into the next chapter of our economic growth story.
4.81		 As India deepens its integration with GVCs, outward investment has emerged as 
an important complement to inward FDI in shaping India’s external sector. The steady 
rise in ODI reflects the growing competitiveness of Indian firms, their efforts to secure 
technology, markets, and resources abroad and the enabling effect of the liberalised 
ODI framework introduced in 2022. These trends underscore a structural shift to 
an economy whose enterprises are increasingly engaging in global expansion.93 Box 
IV.4 examines the evolving contours of India’s ODI and its implications for long-term 
growth.
BOX IV.4: Impact of Outward FDI on the home country
International investment flows reflect growing economic integration, with inward FDI 
signalling investor confidence and outward FDI reflecting the internationalisation and 
competitiveness of domestic firms. In recent decades, developing economies have become 
increasingly prominent sources of outward FDI (OFDI), with their share in global FDI 
outflows rising from nearly 7 per cent in 2000 to close to 30 per cent by 2024, signifying the 
internationalisation of enterprises from traditionally capital-scarce regions.

competitiveness through knowledge internalisation, capability enhancement, and greater 
participation in GVCs. Assessing home-country effects of OFDI, therefore, requires moving 
beyond concerns of capital flight towards evaluating longer-term productivity and innovation 
impacts.
Channels of impact
Knoerich (2017)94 outlines three principal channels through which OFDI can generate 
home-country gains: (i) financial returns through repatriated profits, dividends payments 
and intra-firm transfers that strengthen foreign exchange earnings and potentially relax 
financing constraints for parent firms; (ii) intangible capability gains as firm’s overseas 
operations expose firms to new technologies, managerial know-how, regulatory & quality 
standards, and global customer preferences. (iii) tangible capacity gains from acquiring 
resources, brands, and distribution networks, which deepen domestic production networks, 
foster product upgrading, and facilitate entry into higher value-added segments of GVCs. 
The overall effect of OFDI on the home economy depends on domestic absorptive capacity 
(skills, R&D, institutions, and financial depth) as well as policies that support the domestic 
assimilation of overseas knowledge and investment.
Chart IV. 19: Investment Development Path 
Net Outward Investment becomes persistently positive only at later stages as domestic firms accumulate 
capabilities.
Note: IDP stages adapted from Dunning & Narula (1996)
The Investment Development Path (IDP) framework (Dunning, 198195; Dunning and Narula, 
199696) posits that countries evolve from being predominantly inward FDI recipients in early 
development stages to net outward investors as their productive capabilities, technological 
depth, and institutional maturity improve. India is generally assessed to be in Stage III of

the IDP, with outward investments increasingly concentrated in technology-intensive 
sectors, indicating a gradual shift from primarily market-seeking investments to asset and 
capability-enhancing overseas ventures [Mohanty et al. (2024)].97
This pattern aligns with cross-country evidence from BRICS and Next-11  economies, where 
GDP growth, trade openness, and financial development are major drivers of OFDI, while 
human capital and inward FDI further reinforce the process in more advanced emerging 
markets such as BRICS. In turn, higher OFDI is associated with improved economic 
dynamism, suggesting a two-way relationship between external investment and domestic 
performance [Mohanty, Sethi and Dash, 2024].98 
Several studies find that OFDI may substitute for domestic investment in the short run 
but complements it in the long run, as firms reinvest earnings, upgrade domestic facilities, 
and strengthen supply chains (Herzer, 201099). Overall, international evidence suggests 
that outcomes are heterogeneous, shaped by sectoral structure, development stage, and the 
nature of outward investment (market-seeking vs. efficiency or asset-seeking).
India’s experience: Empirical evidence from India indicates that OFDI has complemented, 
rather than displaced, domestic investment. Sahoo and Bishnoi (2021)100 use macro-panel 
and time-series approaches to find that outward investment by Indian firms is positively 
associated with domestic investment. Outward-oriented firms have tended to expand 
exports and enhance R&D intensity (Das, 2015101), benefiting from learning and access to 
global markets that mitigate concerns regarding capital outflows and support productivity 
gains at home.
These patterns are consistent with OFDI being used as a mechanism for learning and 
upgrading, rather than as a pure relocation of existing activities. In India, post-liberalisation 
policy reforms since the 1990s, such as the relaxation of OFDI norms, simplification of 
approval processes, and a more open foreign exchange regime, have enabled Indian firms to 
undertake strategic asset-seeking investments abroad. 
Trends in India’s ODI102
India’s recent outward investment trajectory reflects its progression along the Investment 
Development Path, with firms increasingly using overseas ventures to acquire capabilities, 
strategic assets and access to global production systems. Outward investment increased 
from USD 14.4 billion in FY24 to USD 23.6 billion in FY25, driven by greenfield projects,

Conclusion 
In sum, the home-country effects of OFDI are multi-dimensional and context-dependent. A 
common pattern across international and Indian evidence is that outward investment tends 
to reinforce domestic economic strength when underlying capabilities and institutions 
are robust. In contrast, weak absorptive capacity may result in resource diversion without 
adequate spillovers.
As Indian firms expand into higher-value segments, OFDI can serve as a strategic 
instrument for innovation, risk diversification, and global market positioning. The policy 
focus may therefore lie in enhancing repatriation and diffusion of knowledge, easing access 
to finance for globalising firms, and strengthening institutional support for international 
R&D collaboration.

4.82	 	 India's FPI pattern shows recurring cycles of inflows and outflows, with significant 
shifts often linked to global financial changes. While India attracts substantial foreign 
investment, episodes of sharp outflows, such as after the global financial crisis, during 
the 2013 ‘taper tantrum’, the 2018 tightening cycle, and pandemic volatility, reflect 
global financial-cycle sensitivities. These fluctuations underscore how FPI flows, a key 
external capital source, also serve as channels through which global shocks can impact 
domestic markets.

4.83	 A breakdown of FPI components shows how foreign participation has evolved. 
Equity flows tend to dominate in positive years, especially during periods of strong 
earnings and favourable valuations, whereas debt flows are more sensitive to interest 
rates and global risk. The Voluntary Retention Route (VRR)104 and Fully Accessible 
Route (FAR)105 routes have stabilised debt flows, particularly when traditional flows 
were weak.
4.84		 FPIs during FY26 (April-December) have fluctuated, mainly influenced by 
global financial conditions rather than domestic macroeconomic factors. The data 
indicate volatility, with six months of net outflows and three months of sizable net 
inflows, resulting in a modest net balance for the year-to-date. The outflow periods in 
FY26 coincided with periods of tightening global financial conditions, such as rising

limits, or sectoral restrictions in designated G-secs (known as FAR bonds).

US Treasury yields, which often trigger ‘flight-to-safety’ flows into advanced-economy

equities and debt; even categories that typically showed greater stability, such as VRR, 
experienced occasional selling.

4.85		 The three months of inflows in FY26 occurred during periods when global 
markets reassessed the interest-rate outlook and became more receptive to emerging 
market risks (May, October and November). These rebounds were mainly driven by the 
equity segment, supported by renewed interest in India’s corporate earnings trajectory 
and flows into the debt market as global long-term yields declined. The swift return of 
inflows during these periods highlights that foreign investors’ medium-term view of 
India remains positive, even though their short-term allocations are influenced by still-
high valuations of Indian stocks and uncertainty about the trajectory of the India-US 
relationship, amid the high tariffs that Indian goods face in the United States.
Foreign exchange reserves
4.86		 India’s foreign exchange reserves increased to USD 701.4 billion as of 16 January 
2026, up from USD 668.3.4 billion as of the end of March 2025. The increase has come 
at a time when global interest-rate differentials, capital flows and commodity prices 
remain volatile. This expansion in reserves has helped steady India’s external position 
despite shifts in global risk sentiment and episodes of portfolio outflows. In terms of 
adequacy, the reserves as of 16 January 2026 are sufficient to cover around 11 months

slightly from USD 567.6 billion in end March 2025 to USD 560.5 billion as of 16 January 
2026. In contrast, the gold component rose sharply to USD 117.5 billion as of 16 January 
2026, compared with USD 78.2 billion at the end of March 2025. This increase reflects 
both valuation gains during a period of elevated global gold prices and a continued 
preference among central banks for diversifying into non-dollar reserve assets.106
4.88		 The growing share of gold in reserves aligns with a broader international 
pattern where many emerging markets have increased gold holdings amid geopolitical 
uncertainty and shifts in the global interest-rate cycle. SDRs remained stable at USD 
18.7 billion, while India’s reserve position in the IMF increased to USD 4.7 billion.
Exchange rate
4.89		 Between 1 April 2025 and 15 January 2026, the Indian rupee (INR) depreciated by 
approximately 5.4 per cent against the US dollar. This movement was somewhat larger 
than in the immediately preceding period, making INR one of the most depreciated 
currencies alongside the Japanese Yen (-5.5). Other Asian peers experienced relatively 
lower depreciation, such as the Philippine peso (-3.8 per cent) and the Indonesian 
rupiah (-1.9 per cent). In contrast, currencies of economies such as Australia, Brazil and

South Africa appreciated during this period, supported by favourable terms-of-trade 
movements.
4.90		 In the short run (1 April 2025 – 15 January 2026), exchange rate dynamics in India 
were shaped by persistent outflows of foreign investment and evolving bilateral trade 
developments, including tariff-related measures, which together contributed to cautious 
investor sentiment. These pressures were accompanied by episodes of elevated foreign-
currency demand in both spot and forward markets, reflecting hedging behaviour and 
import-related adjustments.107 Such factors amplified short-term currency movements 
even when underlying macroeconomic fundamentals remained stable.
4.91		 Traditional BoP inflows, such as exports and foreign capital, that have 
historically arrested currency depreciation in EMEs, are increasingly influenced by 
global shifts in geopolitical sentiment.108 At the same time, import growth, which exerts 
downward pressure on currencies, tends to rise as these economies advance along their 
development path. With the certainty of import growth and narrower prospects for the 
kind of export and capital inflow growth seen during the hyper-globalisation phase, 
emerging-market currencies can be expected to face persistent depreciation pressures.

capital account dynamics. As shown in Chart IV.24, periods of elevated CAD have 
generally coincided with sharper rupee depreciation, as observed in FY09, FY13, FY19 
and FY23, reflecting pressures from widening merchandise trade deficits. However, 
there have been notable episodes in which rising imports and a widening trade deficit 
did not translate into currency depreciation. In FY08, FY18 and FY22, despite a rapid 
expansion in imports, the rupee appreciated, supported by robust net foreign investment 
inflows. These episodes underscore that exchange-rate movements are influenced not 
merely by the size of the trade deficit, but by the composition and stability of capital 
inflows.
4.93		 This historical association between BoP position and exchange rate movements 
raises an important question about the relative strength of the trade and financial 
channels through which these effects are transmitted. Box IV.5 extends this analysis by 
empirically examining how exchange rate variations are transmitted across different 
components of India’s external sector.
BOX IV.5: Trade and financial channels of the exchange rate
This is a continuation of the box item (Box IV.7: Trade and Financial channels of the 
Exchange rate) seen in the Economic Survey of 2023-24.
The previous analysis (published in July 2024) explored the contrasting impact that a 
weaker currency has on the two key components of the BoP – trade and finance.109 The trade 
channel of the BoP gained from a weaker currency, due to a rise in the cost of imports and 
reducing export prices. On the other hand, a weaker currency does not benefit the financial 
channel of the BoP.  Prolonged currency weakness can raise the cost of foreign lending and 
lead to a net capital outflow. The box concluded that for India, the benefits stemming from 
a weaker currency on the trade channel far outweighed the costs arising from the financial 
channel. On balance, therefore, a weaker currency was beneficial for India’s BoP. 
The discussion on whether a weaker currency supports the BoP as opposed to a stronger 
one continues to be a relevant one. Building on the previous box, this analysis offers a more 
disaggregated picture of the trade channel of the exchange rate by analysing the impact of 
exchange rate movements on both merchandise and services trade. The analysis utilises 
external sector data at a quarterly frequency between Q1 of FY12 to Q2 of FY26, employing 
an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, which is well-suited for small sample 
regressions and controls for endogeneity.
The study employs four separate ARDL regressions using dependent variables such as net 
total trade, net merchandise trade, net services trade and net capital balance. The basic form 
of the regression is as shown below:
∆ lnYt = γi∑Yt-1 +  βi∑∆Exch Ratet + θXt + εt
109 For a detailed exploration of the trade and financial channel of the exchange rate, see for instance, Kearns, J., &

Where ln Yt refers to BoP variables such as net total trade, net merchandise trade, net 
services trade and net capital balance. The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) is the 
exchange rate variable of interest for the regression which analyses net total trade and net 
merchandise trade. For the regression which analyses services trade, the relevant exchange 
rate variable is Rupee denominated in US dollar terms.110 Finally, the regression which 
analyses the financial channel uses net capital balance as the dependent variable and a 
debt-weighted exchange rate (DWER) is used as the exchange rate variable. The DWER was 
constructed using a basket of currencies weighted by their share in India’s external debt.
The coefficient βi indicates the elasticity of changes in BoP variables to changes in the 
exchange rate. Xt includes control variables such as World imports, 10-year G-sec yield, 
commodity prices, domestic demand, the GDP deflator, and a dummy for the COVID-19 
years (March 2020 to March 2022).
For each regression, optimal lags were selected using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), 
Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQ) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). Post-estimation 
checks for autocorrelation and parameter stability were conducted.
Results and interpretation
The results reaffirm that a weaker exchange rate is beneficial for India's trade balance. A 
one per cent appreciation of the Rupee results in net total trade declining by 1.26 per cent. 
If the Rupee strengthens, the merchandise trade balance becomes more negative, with an 
elasticity of -1.45, indicating that merchandise trade is highly responsive to exchange rate 
movements. Conversely, if the Rupee weakens, the trade balance improves substantially. 
On a net basis, therefore, a weaker currency is good for India's merchandise trade balance.
Within the trade basket, services trade exhibits relatively inelastic behaviour, with an 
elasticity of -0.38. This limited sensitivity likely reflects India's market power in services 
exports, where demand has become less price-dependent and more reliant on quality and 
specialised expertise.

exports) are invoiced in the US dollar (Source – RBI’s survey on computer service and IT enabled services

fact that an appreciation can improve the creditworthiness of local borrowers who have 
Rupee-denominated assets and borrow in foreign currencies. However, the lagged effect 
of an appreciation reverses this gain, with capital inflows declining by 1.02 per cent in 
subsequent periods. This delayed negative impact may reflect central bank intervention 
following periods of significant appreciation and capital inflows, which moderates exchange 
rate movements and subsequently affects capital flow dynamics.

India’s exchange rate: Underlying drivers
4.94		 In India’s case, as the fastest-growing among major economies, its rapid economic 
growth is naturally driving up import demand. Faster growth increases the need for 
machinery, electronics, industrial inputs and energy. Moreover, even an increase in 
export growth can lead to higher imports, as many export industries rely on imported 
components to some extent. As a result, strong domestic demand, investment-led 
expansion, and heavy energy dependence combine to make higher growth translate into 
higher imports, which are necessary to sustain manufacturing expansion and India's 
integration into GVCs, resulting in persistent trade deficits, which, in turn, translate 
into a wider CAD. In addition, sustained demand for gold, even during periods of 
elevated global gold prices, further pressures the trade balance.
4.95		 Financing this current account gap places greater reliance on capital inflows. On 
this front, India has continued to attract investor interest, as reflected in rising gross 
FDI inflows (Chart IV.16). However, the global environment has shifted markedly. 
Policy interest rates in major AEs have risen from near-zero levels to around 4-5 per 
cent over the past few years, making global capital scarcer and more contested. As a 
result, India is competing not only with other emerging market economies but also with 
AEs actively seeking to retain investment onshore. Taken together, growth-led current 
account pressures and tighter global financial conditions reinforce the exchange-rate 
pressures on the Indian economy in the prevailing geopolitical environment.

outcomes over the medium to long term are fundamentally anchored in a country’s

savings-investment balance and its resulting current account position. Historical 
experience across economies suggests that sustained currency strength is typically 
associated with persistently high domestic savings and current account surpluses. 
Countries such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Germany and Switzerland have seen 
their currencies appreciate steadily over long horizons due to their surplus external 
positions. Conversely, economies that have transitioned into persistent CADs, notably 
the UK and the US, have generally experienced weaker currency trajectories over time, 
notwithstanding episodic phases of strength. This suggests that, going forward, durable 
currency strength is unlikely without the ability to generate high domestic savings and 
sustained external surpluses. 
4.97		 Moreover, international experience further suggests that the transition from 
persistent CAD to sustained surpluses and correspondingly currency credibility has 
typically been mediated by the structure and composition of export growth. In this 
context, Box IV.6 discusses the experience of several East Asian economies, which offers 
useful insights into the role of manufacturing exports and complementary services in 
shaping durable exchange-rate outcomes.
Box IV.6: Manufactured Exports, Services and Currency Credibility: 
Lessons from East Asia
Currencies that are considered stable and credible in global markets usually reflect deeper 
economic strengths. Beyond sound macroeconomic policy, credibility builds over time when 
an economy reliably earns foreign exchange, including during periods of stress. Across 
several successful industrialising economies, especially in East Asia, a common pattern is 
visible: strong growth in manufacturing exports preceded improvements in current account 
positions, reserve accumulation and the gradual strengthening of currency credibility.
Rapid growth and investment typically lead to increased imports of machinery, capital 
goods, intermediate inputs and energy. Unless export capacity expands at a similar pace, 
growth can place pressure on the BoP.111 The East Asian response to this constraint was to 
make manufacturing exports a central part of their development strategy. In Japan after the 
Second World War and in South Korea and Taiwan from the 1970s onwards, production 
shifted progressively toward machinery, transport equipment, electronics, precision 
instruments, and other complex manufactured goods.112 These sectors connected domestic 
firms to global supply chains, creating export streams that were larger, more diversified, 
and more durable than those based on primary commodities or low-value assembly.
Over time, persistent export strength translated into current account surpluses, accumulation 
of reserves and foreign assets, and greater confidence that these economies could manage

external shocks without major disruption. Currency credibility followed this process 
gradually, as sustained external surpluses, rising foreign asset positions and the resilience of 
export earnings through global downturns became visible to markets. A notable exception is 
the US, where the global strength of the dollar reflects financial depth and reserve-currency 
status rather than export surpluses; this represents a distinct pathway not typically available 
to late-industrialising economies.
Industrial policy played an important supporting role, but it was designed differently from 
approaches that rely mainly on permanent protection. In many East Asian cases, support 
was selective, time-bound and linked to performance. Governments employed tools such as 
preferential credit, investment coordination, or temporary tariff relief, but these measures 
were generally accompanied by expectations of improved productivity, increased scale, and 
entry into export markets. Firms that failed to compete internationally were not guaranteed 
continued shelter. Export performance thus acted as a practical test of whether capabilities 
were genuinely being built.
An equally important feature was the careful treatment of protection in different parts 
of the production system. Policymakers were generally cautious about extending strong 
protection to upstream producers of basic materials and intermediate goods, such as steel, 
petrochemicals or industrial fibres, when these inputs were widely used across downstream 
manufacturing.113 High protection in these upstream sectors risked raising costs for a much 
larger set of firms engaged in export-oriented production. Where investment in upstream 
capacity was encouraged, it was usually combined with an emphasis on cost competitiveness 
and export orientation, rather than insulation that shifted costs onto user industries. The 
experience suggests that, in complex industrial ecosystems, decisions about what not to 
protect can be as important as decisions about what to support.
Within firms, this policy structure encouraged learning and technological upgrading. 
Access to imported capital goods, investments in technical education, standards and testing 
infrastructure, and targeted research support helped raise productivity in manufacturing. 
As firms moved into higher-value segments, exports became more sophisticated and less 
easily replaceable. This complexity provided a degree of resilience: participation in GVCs 
and the reliability associated with these products helped sustain foreign exchange earnings 
even when global conditions weakened.
The result was not an immediate transformation of currency status, but a steady strengthening 
of BoP fundamentals. Japan’s emergence as a major exporter in the 1960s and 1970s, and 
Korea and Taiwan’s transition to sustained current account surpluses after the 1980s, 
coincided with greater confidence in their ability to manage external risks. In each case, the 
credibility of the currency reflected the accumulated strength of the external sector, rather 
than being achieved solely through financial signalling.
A natural question in the contemporary context is whether strong service exports can 
play a similar role. Modern tradable services, including information technology, logistics, 
finance and business services, are now significant contributors to export earnings in many 
economies.

They support income growth and help moderate external pressures. However, international 
experience indicates that services exports, by themselves, rarely generate the same degree 
of scale, employment linkages, or counter-cyclical support as broad-based manufacturing 
export growth, particularly in large and fast-growing economies.114
Overall, the East Asian experience points to a broad conclusion. Durable external resilience 
and stronger currency credibility have, in most successful late-industrialising economies, 
emerged from the gradual build-up of manufacturing export capacity, supported by 
disciplined, productivity-oriented industrial policy, careful management of input costs 
across value chains, and the complementary growth of high-value services. Where this 
combination has persisted over time, the outcome has been more robust external balances 
and greater confidence in the economy’s ability to navigate global shocks.
4.98		 These cross-country experiences highlight that durable currency strength has 
rarely emerged as a by-product of financial openness or macroeconomic signalling alone. 
Instead, it has been grounded in the gradual build-up of export capabilities, particularly 
in manufacturing. For India, this implies that improving medium-term exchange-rate 
outcomes is inseparable from building a strong and competitive manufacturing base 
anchored in export growth.
4.99		 Manufacturing exports remain the most reliable channel through which 
productivity gains, scale economies and global demand can be translated into durable 
current account improvement. While India’s manufacturing base has expanded in 
absolute terms, progress in moving towards more sophisticated and diversified export 
capabilities has been uneven. This is reflected in India’s trajectory on the ECI, as 
discussed in paragraph 4.44 above. As shown in Chart IV.25, the CAGR of services 
exports has consistently exceeded that of merchandise exports.

4.100	 Innovation-related indicators present a similar picture of gradual progress 
accompanied by relative slippage. India has improved its standing in the World 
Intellectual Property Organisation’s  Global Innovation Index over the past decade and 
is consistently assessed as performing above expectations for its income level. These 
gains can be attributed to policy reforms, digital transformation, and a vibrant startup 
ecosystem. However, India’s improvement has been slower than that of several peer 
economies, including China, particularly on indicators related to high-technology 
manufacturing and private R&D expenditure. This suggests that while innovation 
inputs have strengthened, their translation into globally competitive manufacturing 
and export outcomes remains incomplete.
4.101	 Sustained export competitiveness will ultimately rest on the ability to deliver 
consistent quality at scale, which in turn depends on a deeper culture of innovation, 
continuous productivity improvement and investment in R&D by the private sector. 
Government initiatives, such as the ANRF and RDIF, can act as catalytic enablers in 
this process; however, the primary onus will lie with the private sector to scale up R&D 
spending, adopt advanced technologies and internalise quality-driven production 
norms. This transformation will also require states to create an enabling ecosystem 
for innovation, investment, and industrial scaling, so that these forces can operate 
effectively, as discussed in greater detail in Chapter 16 of this Survey. 
4.102	 Complementing this process, FDI assumes a critical role beyond its contribution 
to financing. Stable FDI facilitates technology transfer, productivity enhancement and 
integration into GVCs, thereby strengthening export capacity and productivity over 
time. Deeper GVC integration, however, will require a coordinated, mission-mode 
approach involving close inter-ministerial collaboration at the Union level and effective 
coordination with State governments. Portfolio flows, by contrast, are inherently more 
volatile and sensitive to shifts in global financial conditions. Policy efforts in this domain 
should therefore prioritise ease of doing business through procedural simplification, 
streamlining tax processes and facilitating greater participation by non-resident 
investors. 
4.103	 Over the long run, the exchange rate outcomes are thus a reflection of economic 
fundamentals. At the same time, in the short term, they are shaped by investor sentiment 
and capital flow dynamics, leading to phases of both undershooting and overshooting 
relative to fundamentals.  Over time, however, currency performance will be determined 
by the economy’s ability to generate domestic savings, sustain external balance, attract 
stable FDI, and build export competitiveness rooted in innovation, productivity and 
quality.

This position was maintained in Q2 CY 2025, with Germany and China emerging as 
the two largest creditor economies, followed closely by Japan, with a NIIP of USD 3.6 
trillion. At the other end of the spectrum, the US remained the world’s largest debtor, 
with a NIIP of USD 26.1 trillion at Q2 CY 2025, followed by Brazil, France and Spain. 
India ranked as the 11th largest debtor globally, with a negative NIIP of USD 0.3 trillion 
as of Q2 CY 2025.

4.105	 India historically has a net debtor status. During FY25, net claims of non-

overseas financial assets (+USD 105.4 billion) compared to external financial liabilities 
(+USD 74.2 billion). Over 72 per cent of the rise in India’s overseas financial assets was 
due to an increase in overseas direct investment, currency and deposits, and reserve 
assets. On the liabilities side, inward direct investments, loans, as well as currency and

Correspondingly, net IIP as a ratio to GDP improved to -8.7 per cent, compared to 
-10.1 per cent a year ago and -14.1 per cent five years earlier, highlighting a sustained 
strengthening of India’s external balance sheet.117
External debt
4.107	 Global external debt continued to rise in CY 2024 amid tight global financial 
conditions and elevated policy rates. At end-December 2024, global external debt stood 
at USD 104.4 trillion, up 1.4 per cent from a year earlier. AEs accounted for 88.1 per 
cent of the total (USD 92.0 trillion), while EMDEs recorded a faster expansion, with 
external debt rising to USD 12.4 trillion.
4.108	 In the global context, India ranked 21st worldwide and 11th within the G20 
at end-December 2024, with an external debt stock of USD 718.2 billion, a 10.7 per 
cent increase YoY. Despite this expansion, India remains modestly leveraged, with an 
external debt-to-GDP ratio of 18.4 per cent, well below that of many large economies118. 
Accordingly, India accounts for only 0.69 per cent of global external debt, underscoring 
its relatively small contribution to global indebtedness.

per cent of the government of India’s total debt, which mitigates the external sector

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 
4.110	 A fundamental reordering of the global economic landscape is shaping India’s 
external sector outlook. Trade, investment and capital flows are increasingly influenced 
by geopolitical alignments, industrial policy and strategic considerations, implying that 
the external environment is likely to remain volatile and less supportive than during 
the earlier phase of hyper-globalisation. For emerging market economies, this shift 
entails greater competition for capital, slower expansion of global trade volumes and 
heightened sensitivity of external flows to policy and geopolitical developments.
4.111	 India’s external sector remains strong, with deepening global integration 
driven by robust exports, resilient services trade, and expanding trade networks. This 
reflects increased competitiveness, diversification, and adaptability to global demand. 
Services exports lead, while non-petroleum merchandise exports hit record levels, 
showcasing growth in high-value manufacturing and knowledge trade. This strength 
is supported by healthy foreign exchange reserves and a moderate external debt 
profile. 
4.112	 As growth-driven import demand increases with greater global integration, 
India’s external sustainability depends on the quality and stability of its financing. The

composition of capital inflows is key. FDI is the most stable source, supporting BoP 
stability, productivity, technology transfer, and export growth. Maintaining FDI amid 
a competitive global capital market requires improving the investment climate, deeper 
GVC integration, and coordinated policies across government levels.
4.113	  The current environment also highlights the importance of achieving strong 
export growth, making an export-oriented policy a pressing necessity. A robust 
and stable currency can only be achieved through export competitiveness. History 
demonstrates that countries with sustained manufacturing export success are those 
that have maintained hard currency status, characterised by currency stability and 
strength.
4.114	 This requires a unified effort to reduce manufacturing costs, thereby enhancing 
the country's export competitiveness. This includes correcting inverted duties, improving 
logistics infrastructure, lowering logistics costs, and reducing regulatory expenses. 
Simultaneously, selective import substitution that is not unlimited but grounded in 
productivity, export competitiveness, and measurable results may be considered. 
4.115	 In sum, India’s external sector enters this phase of global fragmentation with 
strengthened buffers, diversified trade linkages and improving resilience. The policy 
challenge lies in leveraging these strengths to sustain external stability while supporting 
a high-growth trajectory in a world where global integration is increasingly shaped by 
strategic, rather than purely economic considerations. Over the medium to long term, 
this underscores the importance of policies that support manufacturing competitiveness, 
innovation, productivity and quality, alongside efforts to mobilise domestic savings.
