  "summary": [
    "emerging trends in State-level debt and deficits underscore the need for continued calibration. The recommendations of the Sixteenth Finance Commission will play a critical role in shaping Centre-State fiscal relations, influencing the quantum and composition of resource transfers, and thereby affecting State-level fiscal outcomes. At the same time, the increasing reliance by some States on unconditional cash transfer programmes has altered expenditure composition, raising concerns about expenditure rigidity and medium-term fiscal flexibility. While such transfers serve important distributional objectives, their scale and design need to be balanced against the imperative of preserving space for growth-enhancing investments. Improved targeting, periodic review, and outcome-oriented design can help mitigate fiscal rigidities.",
    "2.57 From a macro perspective, any fiscal indiscipline at the State level also casts a shadow on the sovereign borrowing costs. With markets pricing government debt on a consolidated basis, persistent revenue deficits or an expansion of committed expenditures at the State level could affect sovereign bond yields. This underscores the importance of coordinated fiscal discipline across levels of government, where fiscal policy is oriented toward expanding productive capacity and income growth rather than creating permanent expenditure commitments. Strengthening the fiscal capacity of local bodies, in line with constitutional intent, can also help improve expenditure efficiency and investment outcomes at the grassroots level.",
    "2.58 Looking ahead, ongoing reforms in taxation, including GST 2.0 and personal income tax, are expected to enhance the efficiency of the tax system by simplifying structures, reducing compliance costs, and broadening the tax base, with implications for both economic activity and revenue mobilisation. In parallel, wider use of digital systems in tax administration and public financial management is likely to strengthen compliance, improve expenditure disbursements, and enhance fiscal transparency.",
    "Together, these measures will enable progress along the medium-term debt path, thereby strengthening macroeconomic stability.",

    "FY26 (April-December 2025), underpinned by strategic policy actions and structural resilience across financial intermediation channels. In response to moderating inflation, the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee reduced the repo rate, while injecting durable liquidity through cash reserve ratio cuts and open market operations. These measures have been effectively transmitted to lending rates, with the weighted average lending rates of scheduled commercial banks declining. The banking sector has simultaneously strengthened its fundamentals, with gross non-performing asset ratios declining to multidecadal lows and profit after tax increasing, signalling improved asset quality and profitability.",
    "Capital formation has been particularly robust in primary equity markets.",
    "Household financial savings have increasingly shifted towards equities and mutual funds, with the share of equity-linked instruments in annual household savings rising, reflecting the deepening financialisation of domestic savings.",
    "Financial inclusion has advanced substantially through digital public infrastructure, fintech lending, and government-led microcredit initiatives. India’s first international financial service centre at GIFT City is creating an enabling ecosystem for attracting and channelling global capital. Significant strides have been made in providing social security cover to citizens in terms of pension and insurance.",
    "While India’s financial system is becoming more resilient, diversified, and inclusive, it faces new challenges emanating from dynamic forces. These challenges incude the need to improve regulations, manage the use of AI in finance, and scale up to meet the demands of a growing, aspirational population.",
    "This necessitates that the regulatory authorities navigate prudently to reconcile growth with stability."

Globalised finance has led to lower borrowing costs, greater access to capital, and improved international risk sharing.1 However, in the presence of rapid geopolitical fragmentation, the financial sector has become a channel for the transmission of global shocks. Thus, emerging markets face the task of leveraging the benefits of globalised finance and simultaneously minimising the costs that stem from volatile shocks. In this context, regulatory innovation, transparency, and accountability are crucial for addressing the challenges of an uncertain era. Moreover, tapping into innovative and inclusive channels of domestic finance is necessary, as these can serve as a buffer against shocks to volatile global finance and simultaneously advance the goals of growth and development."

This progression correlates with measurable business outcomes.

Key imperatives include enhancing transparency, pricing risk honestly beyond the siloes of AAA-rated bonds, and ensuring financial innovation remains standardised. Mechanisms such as partial guarantees and blended finance can help mid-tier companies access bond markets, unlocking capital for this segment and driving India's future growth. Equally, a shift from passive buy-and- hold strategies to active trading is essential for building secondary market liquidity. A well-functioning debt market would reduce capital costs, mobilise savings efficiently, and offer households reliable income-generating products. India's households have embraced equities; extending that confidence to debt markets is the next frontier for building truly resilient portfolios and a mature financial system."

The path forward necessitates decisive shifts. Insurers must prioritise the digitisation of distribution to rationalise acquisition costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder.
