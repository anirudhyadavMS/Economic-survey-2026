  "summary": [
    "FRONTIER The global economic environment remains uncertain, shaped by geopolitical tensions, trade disruptions, and divergent growth and inflation outcomes across major economies. While global activity has shown resilience in the near term, underlying vulnerabilities persist, including elevated fiscal pressures, fragmented supply chains, and an increased reliance on economic policy instruments for strategic purposes.",
    "Against this backdrop, the Indian economy has maintained strong growth momentum in FY26. The First Advance Estimates place real GDP growth at 7.4 per cent, with growth largely driven by domestic demand. Private consumption and capital formation continue to support expansion, while services remain the key contributor on the supply side. Manufacturing activity has strengthened, and agriculture has provided stability, notwithstanding structural constraints.",
    "The chapter analyses demand and supply-side developments during the first half of FY26, supported by high-frequency indicators for the third quarter. It highlights the role of consumption and investment in sustaining growth, even as external demand provides incremental support amid challenging global conditions. To supplement official estimates, the chapter also uses high-frequency indicators and an in-house nowcasting framework to assess near-term growth trends.",
    "The chapter reviews key macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation, financial sector conditions, fiscal developments, external sector performance, and labour market trends. Inflation has moderated, financial sector balance sheets remain healthy, and fiscal policy continues to strike a balance between supporting growth and consolidation. The external sector remains manageable, supported by services exports and adequate foreign exchange reserves.",
    "Looking ahead, while global uncertainties remain elevated, domestic growth drivers are expected to continue supporting economic activity. With macroeconomic stability in place and ongoing reform efforts, the economy appears well-positioned to sustain growth in the near term. The outlook for FY27 is shaped by these domestic strengths, alongside evolving external conditions. The chapter concludes that India’s medium-term growth potential has strengthened to 7 per cent, positioning the economy on a path of steady expansion amid global uncertainty."

The long promised reciprocal tariffs, announced in April 2025, initially sparked concerns about lower growth and higher inflation in the global economy which have proven to be transient in the short run. This was due to multiple reasons. Trade agreements between the US and certain trading partners have considerably lowered the US’s effective tariff rate. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO), October 2025, US households and businesses increased their spending ahead of expected tariff hikes. In some instances, delays in tariff implementation allowed businesses to postpone raising prices and frontload their exports. As a result, global economic activity has remained relatively stable in the short term. This is reflected in the IMF’s projections of growth and inflation for advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market and developing economies"

While inflation in Europe is broadly trending towards the European Central Bank’s target, growth in the region’s economies has been mixed. Forecasts by the European Commission2 indicate that growth rates in Germany, Italy, and France are expected to remain moderate, while Spain is anticipated to outperform. In Asia, the Chinese economy continues to face deflationary pressures amid headwinds stemming from the crisis in its property sector, indicating tepid domestic demand, even as Chinese merchandise exports remain a key driver of its growth. Growth in the Japanese economy remains moderate, while inflation continues to exceed the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) target of 2 per cent."
