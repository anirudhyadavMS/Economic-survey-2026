EDUCATION AND HEALTH: 
WHAT WORKS AND WHAT’S 
NEXT
India's journey toward Viksit Bharat hinges on inclusive growth and upward 
social and economic mobility for every citizen. The development model of India 
is based on the principle of leaving no one behind. The government is working 
towards this goal through multiple initiatives focused on enhancing education 
and healthcare, the core pillars of human capital and overall well-being. 
 In the education space, progress in school and higher education has been at the 
back of enhanced quality and access through community engagement, effective 
assessments, improved accountability, and stronger alignment between 
education and skill requirements. Building state capacity in higher education, 
fostering academia-industry collaboration, and expanding global engagement 
can further enhance the education system’s responsiveness to the changing 
needs of the economy. Health outcomes have improved through infrastructure 
expansion and targeted policies. Emerging challenges, such as obesity, the rising 
burden of non-communicable diseases, and the psychological effects of digital 
exposure, require a stronger focus on preventive care and behavioural change 
strategies. This chapter presents good practices in dealing with emerging 
challenges from various parts of the country, offering valuable lessons for 
others to learn from. Enhancing education and healthcare through integrated, 
accountable, and adaptive policy frameworks is essential to building a future-
ready workforce.
INTRODUCTION
11.1.	Public health and education are mutually reinforcing pillars of human capital 
development, social well-being, and economic growth.  In India, the progress in public 
health and education has been marked by notable achievements and continuing 
challenges. Over the years, the country has made significant improvements in increasing 
access to healthcare by providing better and more affordable facilities through public 
investment in health, including access to preventive and curative care, nutrition, and 
health insurance. Infant and maternal mortality rates have reduced, immunisation 
coverage has expanded, and access to primary healthcare services has improved. 
Initiatives like the National Health Mission, Ayushman Bharat, and various disease 
control programmes have contributed to these advancements.

11.2.		 Achievements in the education space have been marked by enhanced literacy 
rates, increasing enrolment in schools and higher education institutions, provision of 
vocational education avenues, etc. The Right to Education Act 2009 and the National 
Education Policy 2020 (NEP) have played a crucial role in shaping the education 
landscape by expanding access to quality education universally, promoting equity, and 
driving innovation in teaching and learning. 
11.3.		 However, variations in quality, regional differences, and socio-economic factors 
continue to influence the equitable distribution of essential services. Both sectors also 
face digital divides and infrastructural gaps, and require investment and policy reforms 
for equitable development.
11.4.		 Against this backdrop, this chapter presents the progress in education and 
health in the country, along with challenges and future pathways. The first section 
discusses the crucial role education plays in developing human capital. It also covers 
community participation, classroom interventions, vocational education, policy 
initiatives to enhance the internationalisation of education, and capacity building for 
higher education. Section two highlights progress and challenges in the health system, 
focusing on policy initiatives to tackle obesity and the rising issue of digital addiction 
among Indian youth. Various other indicators of social progress, such as the extent of 
multidimensional poverty, the delivery of social justice, and the development of the 
country's rural hinterland, are discussed in detail in Chapter 13. 
EDUCATION: ENHANCING QUALITY AND ACCESS
Progress in school education
11.5.		 School education forms the foundation of human capital and is central to shaping 
the nation’s growth path towards Viksit Bharat @2047. Experiences from fast-growing 
Asian economies clearly demonstrate that consistent investments in education, skills 
development, and technology can significantly enhance productivity, foster innovation, 
and accelerate economic transformation.
11.6.		 Strengthening school education today is not just a sectoral reform, but an 
investment in India’s future prosperity, productivity, and leadership in the decades 
ahead. India continues to enjoy a strong demographic advantage. In 2024, nearly 27 
per cent of India’s population was in the school-going age group (3–18 years).1 Even 
by 2047, this age group will account for over 20 per cent. Despite a sizable population 
of school-going children, India’s Education Index, as part of the UN’s Human 
Development Index (HDI), remains modest, largely due to the relatively low expected 
years of schooling (EYS) trailing behind global peers.

11.7.		 To fully convert its vast human resource base into high-quality human capital, 
India needs to raise its EYS to 15-year set by NEP’s 5+3+3+4 schooling structure for 
ages 3-18.2 Achieving this requires a holistic, lifecycle approach that encompasses early 
childhood education, foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN), universal secondary 
schooling, and the seamless integration of vocational and digital skills. 
11.8.		 Towards these goals, the NEP, the first major education policy reform in 34 
years, aims to transform India's education system to address 21st-century challenges. 
It presents a flexible, inclusive, and learner-centric education approach, focusing on 
FLN and higher-order capacities such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and social 
and emotional intelligence. In school education, the policy emphasises Early Childhood 
Care and Education (ECCE), FLN, reducing dropouts, ensuring universal access, 
revamping curriculum and pedagogy, strengthening teacher capacity, promoting equity, 
and improving quality. In higher education, it seeks to restructure and consolidate 
institutions, promote multidisciplinary learning, strengthen faculty, promote vocational 
pathways, ensure equity and facilitate internationalisation. Key initiatives include the 
establishment of the National Research Foundation3 and regulatory reforms aimed at 
driving innovation, excellence, and competitiveness in the education system.
11.9.		 To achieve the goals of NEP, the government launched school-level schemes 
such as the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan, ULLAS4, PM-SHRI(PM-Schools for Rising India), 
PM POSHAN (PM Poshan Shakti Nirman) and initiatives, such as PARAKH, Vidya 
Pravesh, DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing), NIPUN5 Bharat 
Mission and Atal Tinkering Labs. 
2 	 In the NEP5+3+3+4 structure, a strong base of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) from age 3 is 
included as part of formal education, which is aimed at promoting better overall learning, development, and 
well-being.

School infrastructure
11.10.	 India today operates one of the world’s largest school systems, serving 24.69 
crore students across 14.71 lakh schools, supported by over 1.01 crore teachers (UDISE+ 
2024-25).6 Government schools constitute 69 per cent of all schools, enrolling nearly 
half of all students, while private schools account for 26 per cent of schools and 41 
per cent of total enrolment. Aligned with the NEP goal of achieving a 100 per cent 
gross enrolment ratio (GER) from pre-primary to secondary education by 2030, steady 
progress has been observed across all school levels.7 GER scores, as per NEP academic 
structure, are 41.4 at the foundational stage (Pre-Primary to Grade II)8, 95.4 at the 
preparatory stage (Grade III to Grade V), 90.3 at the middle stage (Grade VI to Grade 
VIII), and 68.5 at the secondary stage (Grade IX to Grade XII). Table XI.2 informs 
the achievements of various school education programmes of the government of India. 
Monitoring progress towards the NEP goal of 100 per cent GER by 2030 is being 
enabled through APAAR (Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry) IDs, 
which use Aadhaar-based authentication to digitally store academic records and track 
student enrolment and progression across school, higher, and skill education.

7 	 GER is the total enrolment in a particular level of school education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage 
of the population of the official age-group which corresponds to the given level of school education in a given 
school year.
8 	 Lower GER at the foundational stage is due to GER being calculated using Pre-Primary enrolments in recognised 
schools as reported by States/UTs, which excludes Anganwadi enrolments and enrolments in standalone Private 
Pre-Primary Schools. As per previous academic structure GER scores are 90.9 at the primary stage (Grade I to V), 
90.3 at the upper primary (Grade VI to VIII), 78.7 at the secondary stage (Grade IX and X) and 58.4 at the higher 
secondary stage (Grade XI and XII).

2024, and female participation in learning activities among this age group increased 
from 85.6 per cent to 89.5 per cent, during the same period.11 Children in this age group 
spend approximately 413 minutes daily on learning. In rural areas, children dedicate 
83 minutes to sports and exercise daily, compared to 68 minutes in urban areas.

Innovative pedagogy and community participation 
11.12.	 While India has improved enrolment at early levels, the secondary age-specific 
net enrolment (NER) remains low at 52.2 per cent, highlighting the need to retain 
students beyond Grade VIII.13 A key issue is the uneven distribution of schools: 54 
per cent of schools offer only foundational-preparatory education, while just 17.1 per 
cent provide secondary education in rural areas. Urban areas have a higher share of 
secondary schools (38.1 per cent). This disparity limits rural students' access to higher-
level classes, resulting in transition losses, increased travel time, and higher dropout rates. 
11.13.	 These structural imbalances are reflected in enrolment patterns, with a drop in 
enrolment from the foundational and preparatory levels to the middle and to  secondary 
levels in rural areas, whereas in urban areas, enrolment rises from the middle to the 
secondary level. Grade-wise enrolment trends further highlight the decline at the 
secondary stage.

11.14.	 India has made notable gains in school enrolment by strengthening infrastructure 
and teacher capacity, with schemes like Poshan Shakti Nirman and Samagra Shiksha 
Abhiyan promoting access and equity. Further action is required, especially as the focus 
shifts from enrolment to learning outcomes. Policy interventions to expand composite 
and integrated schools, upgrading schools up to Class XII, and strengthening open 
schooling are vital for improving retention and optimising resources. Improving 
infrastructure, teacher skills through strengthened DIETs (District Institute of Education 
& Training), and SCERTs (State Council of Educational Research and Training), and 
involving parents and communities in governance can create an inclusive, learner-
focused environment. Combining these strategies with curriculum and assessment 
reforms aligned with NEP and the use of digital platforms such as PM e-Vidya can 
provide high-quality, equitable education, even in remote areas. Box XI.1 highlights 
how community participation improves educational outcomes.
Box XI.1: Empowering change in Indian education 
through community participation
Education occurs not only in schools, but also within families, communities, and society as 
a whole, and evidence shows that community-school partnerships boost accountability14,15, 
enrolment, and children’s FLN.16 Parental involvement in education encourages children to 
work harder and achieve greater academic success.17
Community mobilisation for enhancing enrolment and learning outcomes is not new in India 
and has been part of the education landscape for decades. Campaigns such as ‘Chaduvula 
Panduga’ in Andhra Pradesh (launched during 1999–2002) and ‘Alokar Jatra’ in Assam 
(launched in 2002) illustrate how large-scale community mobilisation can improve access 
and enrolment and create local databases on children's educational status.18 The ‘Aao 
School Chalein’ initiative in Haryana addresses student enrolment challenges through a 
micro-improvement approach and collaboration. Empowering school leaders, leveraging 
technology, and engaging stakeholders promote community participation to increase 
enrolment.19

Another example is the Zilla Parishad School Jalindarnagar, a public primary school in 
Taluka Khed, Maharashtra, which has pioneered a peer-learning ‘Subject Friend’ model in 
response to teacher shortages. The method requires grouping mixed-age students under 
older students for support in lessons and homework, thereby strengthening comprehension, 
confidence, and participation. This student-led approach has fostered inclusive, collaborative 
classrooms, expanded learning to advanced subjects such as coding, robotics, electronics, 
and multilingual education, increased enrolment to 120 students, and catalysed strong 
community engagement, with parents and local experts volunteering to teach vocational 
and academic skills and to co-maintain school infrastructure, leading as a model for wider 
replication.20 The school's innovative intervention has received global recognition, with the 
institution being named the World’s Best School in 2025 for the Community Choice Award 
by the T4 Education platform.21
Community engagement serves purposes beyond accountability. Teacher communities 
provide crucial peer support, boost motivation, and facilitate the implementation of 
policy initiatives at the ground level.  Teachers in isolated Zilla Parishad schools often 
feel disconnected and demotivated due to the limited opportunities for recognition. This 
highlights the importance of building motivated teacher communities by leveraging 
technology and behavioural insights, creating platforms for peer learning and practice-
sharing, and institutionalising recognition of teachers through appreciation at block- and 
district-level meetings.22
Community-based learning offers students real-world, practical experiences outside 
traditional schools. This method helps students link their academic knowledge with 
community needs, promoting a deeper understanding and greater engagement. Additionally, 
it fosters empathy, social responsibility, and leadership skills by exposing students to a 
variety of community issues.
Improvement in learning outcomes 
11.15.	 In the evolving landscape of education, learning assessments are vital for 
evaluating the education systems by identifying gaps and for setting priorities for 
improvement and innovation. Since 2001, National Achievement Surveys (NAS) 
conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) have 
provided valuable insights into the school education system. Building on this and with 
a focus on competency-based learning, PARAKH (Performance Assessment, Review, 
and Analysis of Knowledge for Holistic Development) Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024 was 
20  https://t4.education/5-prizes-finalists-winners/zp-school-jalindarnagar/
21  T4 Education is a global platform bringing together a community of over 200,000 teachers from more than 100 
countries to transform education.  
22	NGOs, like the Open Links Foundation, have been working with the district administration on building such 
teacher communities (https://www.openlinksfoundation.org/)

launched.23 Its main objective is to evaluate students' learning outcomes, competency, 
and holistic progress across key grades and provide a guide for policy, curriculum, and 
resource planning. 
11.16.	 The PARAKH 2024 findings inform that Grade III results show promising 
recovery post-COVID. Girls slightly outperformed boys in Language (65 per cent 
vs. 63 per cent), while both scored equally in Mathematics (60 per cent). Rural 
students outperformed their urban peers, and state government schools led the way 
in foundational outcomes, validating the impact of NIPUN Bharat. Compared to NAS 
2021 and 2017, Grade III proficiency levels have rebounded significantly, with 65 per 
cent of students proficient in Mathematics (up from 42 per cent in 2021) and 57 per 
cent in Language (up from 39 per cent).
11.17.	  To translate these assessment insights into sustained learning improvements, 
the rollout of Vidya Samiksha Kendras across all states/UTs will play a key role in 
standardising administrative practices and regulations, enabling real-time, data-driven 
monitoring of every child’s learning outcomes, thereby supporting timely interventions. 
While the PARAKH Rashtriya Sarvekshan has strengthened learning assessment 
in India, going forward, it is essential to move beyond aggregate scores to identify 
underlying learning gaps and areas of conceptual confusion among students. This calls 
for further strengthening of the assessment system and strategy, so that assessment 
results effectively support improvements in learning outcomes through enhanced 
teacher capacity and pedagogy, as discussed in Box XI.2.
Box XI.2: Reimagining school education: Strengthening meaningful 
assessments and enhancing accountability 
The present education policy landscape is being shaped by two complementary imperatives: 
deepening educational quality and reducing regulatory frictions that constrain innovation 
and choice. The next phase of educational transformation necessitates a shift toward 
enhanced accountability, learning measurement, and diversified, participatory delivery 
models. The demographic dividend can only be fully realised if learning outcomes 
improve across socioeconomic groups. There is an opportunity to institutionalise systemic 
assessments, evaluation, benchmarking and widened stakeholder participation to improve 
the quality of education.  
23 	The PARAKH Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024 (formerly National Achievement Survey) was undertaken by the 
National Assessment Centre, PARAKH, NCERT under the aegis of the Department of School Education & Literacy, 
Ministry of Education to understand the baseline performance under the NEP  in development of competencies 
among students at the end of the Foundational, Preparatory, and Middle stages (Grades 3, 6, and 9 respectively) 
of schooling. Nationwide, over 21.15 lakh students, 2.70 lakh teachers, and school leaders from more than 74,000 
schools across 781 districts from all States/UTs participated in the assessment. https://dashboard.parakh.ncert.

Institutionalised systemic assessments 
Large-scale assessments such as the NAS 2021 show that schools predominantly rely on 
internal and board examinations that assess content recall rather than generate diagnostic 
insights.24 Annual Status of Education Report 2024 (ASER) findings highlight gains in 
learning outcomes but also point towards learning gaps variation across states, school types 
and rural-urban contexts. Box XI.3 discusses the findings and policy lessons from ASER.25 
The ASER and NAS findings suggest a deeper structural issue: school-based assessments are 
primarily designed for certification and promotion, and are not able to generate diagnostic 
evidence necessary to identify learning gaps and inform corrective action. 
International experiences in large-scale assessments indicate that they are broader in 
scope. The National Assessment of Educational Progress in the US is conducted every 
two years by the National Centre for Education Statistics and the Institute of Education 
Sciences.26 It provides broad results and specialists’ analysis of student responses in reading 
and math, highlighting common wrong choices that reveal underlying confusion and how 
these patterns vary by grade or state. The findings help update learning standards, teaching 
materials, and professional development, and serve as feedback for practitioners to identify 
where students struggle and which concepts require more focus. The National Assessment 
Programme - Literacy and Numeracy in Australia follows a similar approach.  Schools 
receive detailed analyses allowing teachers to act on the evidence directly. The common 
factor is that assessment data is treated as a tool for course-correction instead of remaining 
a scoreboard.  
In the Indian context, it would be worthwhile to use assessment data to unpack the reasons 
behind the scores, understand errors, and underlying confusions, thereby converting the 
survey into a robust feedback tool for the stakeholders. Further, a complementary initiative 
could be the introduction of a PISA-like assessment at the end of Grade X.27 A standardised 
competency-based assessment that compares states, school types, and socioeconomic 
cohorts on a common scale could provide policymakers with insights for targeted policy 
interventions.
Independent evaluation and system-wide benchmarking
Relying solely on internal compliance and self-reporting of schools could be inadequate; 
achieving effective accountability requires independent oversight, transparent evaluation, 
and external involvement review.28 International experience supports independent 
evaluation as both credible and non-intrusive. The Knowledge and Human Development

Authority in Dubai utilises a tested template: schools are inspected by third-party agencies. 
To ensure consistent benchmarking and improvement, each school is assessed by the same 
agency for several years. Inspections cover learning outcomes, pedagogy, governance, 
inclusion, and wellbeing, with reports shared with the regulator and schools. These reports 
are often made public, influencing parental choice, driving school competition, and 
improving overall quality gains.29
In the Indian context, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking 
improves competition among higher education institutions and helps parents and aspirants 
make informed choices through a common benchmark. It enables comparison between public 
and private institutions, encouraging better governance. Applying similar benchmarking at 
schools could offer related  benefits.  India can also require sharing summary findings of such 
assessments with schools and regulators, creating a feedback loop for quality enhancement.
NITI Aayog’s School Education Quality Index 2019 highlights the wide disparities in 
governance and learning outcomes across states, noting that without independently verified 
monitoring, accountability, and comparability remain weak.30
In this context, a regulated model of external evaluation of schools through accredited third-
party agencies can address the accountability gap without adding bureaucratic burden. 
Empanelling independent agencies and requiring each school to partner with them for a 
minimum two to three-year period would allow for credible benchmarking, continuity in 
assessment and longitudinal tracking to support meaningful school improvement. Where 
benchmarking diversity is desirable, schools may voluntarily engage a second agency in 
parallel. A pilot programme in schools affiliated with the CBSE could be considered to 
develop a benchmarking system. Based on the template developed, states may be encouraged 
to use it with required adaptations, with the voluntary participation of private schools. Such 
benchmarking would form a basis for improved comparability between public and private 
schools, also.
11.18.	 The PARAKH survey goes beyond scores. It reveals that only 35 per cent of schools 
accommodate children with special needs (CWSN), and just 38 per cent have trained 
teachers. Emotional well-being indicators are similarly concerning: only 55 per cent of 
students feel motivated to attend school, and less than half feel emotionally safe. These 
insights underscore the need for the urgent integration of Social-Emotional Learning 
(SEL), peer support systems, and robust child protection policies. The Economic 
Survey 2024-25 (Chapter 11) carried a detailed discussion of various initiatives that 
promote SEL, life skills, and peer-based learning at the school level.31 Building on these 
system-level findings, Box XI.3 discusses how learning outcomes are shaped by factors 
such as age of entry into schools, targeted remediation, digital access, and even parents' 
educational levels.

A key focus of the NEP is to ensure that all students achieve FLN, with the goal that every 
student will reach this level by the end of Grade III. The PARAKH findings highlight the 
improvement in learning outcomes post-pandemic at the foundational stage. These findings 
are complemented by the ASER 2024.32 Two structural factors that are shaping these 
learning gains are parental education and the age of entry into school.

According to ASER 2024, the proportion of educated mothers has increased significantly. 
Evidence suggests that mothers' education has a significant impact on children's academic 
performance.33 In 2014, 43 per cent of mothers with children aged 3-8 had no schooling, but 
by 2024, this figure decreased to 24 per cent. These mothers are a significant demand driver 
for education and improved facilities for their children, as evidenced by the increase in 
Anganwadi enrolment (for 3-year-olds). To capitalise on this trend, policies should include 
community programmes such as adult literacy classes and structured guidelines to build 
mothers’ skills and empower them through health information. Complementary measures 
should support women’s employment and girls’ education, while providing simple weekly 
home-learning activities that enable parents to better support and monitor their children’s 
foundational learning.
ASER 2024 highlights that the age of school entry and age mix in early grades also affect 
learning outcomes. Children aged eight and above in grade II perform better than their 
younger peers, indicating that timely school entry and developmental readiness are crucial. 
The share of underage children (five or below) in Grade I has dropped from 25.6 per cent in 
2018 to 16.7 per cent in 2024, reflecting progress in aligning entry age with policy norms. 
However, improvements are still needed for children to consistently meet grade-level 
expectations.

To address these challenges, Pratham’s Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL) approach groups 
children by learning levels, across or within grades, and uses simple, fun, creative, and 
engaging daily activities. Regular, time-bound assessments are carried out and recorded to 
monitor progress. Based on these assessments, children are re-grouped as they improve.
ASER 2024 also notes progress and challenges in rural India’s digital landscape. Digital 
devices have become widespread among rural youth aged 14-16, with 89.1 per cent having 
smartphone access at home. Among those youth who can use a smartphone, over half 
reported using digital platforms for education, and around 75 per cent use them for social 
media. This presents an opportunity to enhance learning through digital tools. 
By adopting inclusive policies to enhance digital infrastructure and promote responsible 
digital literacy, India can equip its next generation with the skills needed to navigate a 
more connected world. NEP envisions integrating digital technologies across education 
by expanding affordable digital infrastructure and devices to bridge the digital divide and 
enable effective use of digital platforms for teaching and learning. Building on this, policy 
now needs to focus on a delivery mechanism that utilises AI and technology to support 
teachers, ease workloads, enhance the teaching learning process, align education with 
labour market needs, and create a seamless pipeline from education to employment.
School-to-skill pathways
11.19.	 The education system plays a critical role in equipping young people for life after 
school. For children who are out-of-school or are at risk of dropping out, skill-based 
education is a vital intervention that helps them acquire practical skills and improve 
their job prospects.
11.20.	 Most out-of-school children in India are aged 14-18, the typical secondary 
education age. According to PLFS 2023–24, nearly two crore adolescents aged 14–18 
years are out-of-school. The single largest reason for adolescent drop-out is the need 
to supplement household income, accounting for 44 per cent of drop-outs, particularly 
among boys (67.32 per cent). For girls, domestic and care responsibilities remain a 
major constraint, affecting over 55 per cent of those who leave school.

11.21.	 One of the main reasons adolescents do not attend school is to supplement 
their household income. High dropout rates, driven by economic pressures, make 
integrating school-based vocational and skills education an urgent priority. Embedding 
structured skilling pathways in secondary schools can make education more relevant, 
provide early exposure to employable competencies, and transform schools into hubs 
of lifelong learning. The PLFS 2023-24 highlights the limited coverage of training, with 
only 0.97 per cent of 14-18-year-olds having received institutional skilling while nearly 
92 per cent have none. Addressing this gap is crucial for leveraging India’s demographic 
dividend. Skill education in schools would equip young people with market-aligned 
skills, particularly in the service sector, which absorbs over half of the formally trained 
youth, while reducing dropouts by linking education to economic opportunities. 
Strengthening the alignment between school education and national skilling priorities 
is therefore essential for reducing the share of out-of-school children and building a 
productive workforce (Box XI.4).
Box XI.4: Strengthening school education for human 
capital and productivity growth
The evolving skill needs of manufacturing, services, and the digital economy underscore the 
importance of continued schooling up to the higher secondary level. However, PLFS data 
reveal that a large majority of adolescents, 91.94 per cent, report no skilling exposure, while 
7.09 per cent acquired skills informally, without certification or recognised employability 
pathways.

Among those trained formally, over 52.9 per cent are concentrated in IT/ITeS, pointing to 
strong demand for digital skills but also signalling limited access to formal training in other 
high-potential sectors. Training coverage remains very low in areas such as electrical and 
electronics, beauty and wellness, artisan and cottage-based trades, and healthcare and life 
sciences. This indicates a mismatch between the available training opportunities and the 
diverse labour market needs.
To harness the demographic dividend and build a workforce for a modern economy, a 
multipronged approach is needed. Composite schools could be established to ensure 
smooth transitions from pre-primary to higher secondary education. Vocational education 
integration from Grades VI-XII may include practical exposure and industry visits to 
enhance career awareness. Expanded partnerships with industry, Micro, small and medium 
enterprises (MSMEs), and Sector Skill Councils can promote workplace training and 
apprenticeships. Strengthening linkages between schooling, digital skills, and future-ready 
competencies can enhance labour productivity. The section on vocational education in 
Chapter 12 of the Economic Survey provides a detailed framework for enhancing vocational 
and technical education at the school level.

11.24.	 Under the NEP, the higher education system has undergone several reforms. 
The National Credit Framework (NCrF), which aims to blend academic and skills-based

by 153 universities to achieve the NEP target of 50 per cent GER by 2035.39  The NEP’s 
target to build robust R&D capacity and nurture a research-driven culture across 
universities, colleges, and research institutions nationwide has been initiated with the 
establishment of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation. 
11.25.	 Further, NEP’s target to improve the quality of technical education is being 
addressed through the Multidisciplinary Education and Research Improvement in 
Technical Education (MERITE) Scheme for 275 technical institutions, including 175 
engineering colleges and 100 polytechnics, which has been approved recently.40
11.26.	 The NEP envisions a ‘light but tight’ regulatory framework designed to uphold 
integrity, transparency, and efficient use of resources in the education system. The Viksit 
Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan Bill, 2025, introduced in the Lok Sabha on 15 December 
2025, aims to fundamentally reform the higher education regulatory architecture, as 
outlined in NEP.41 The proposed Viksit Bharat Shiksha Adhishthan (VBSA), as the 
apex body, would have three councils: (i) a Regulatory Council, (ii) an Accreditation 
Council, and (iii) a Standards Council for coordination and determination of standards 
in all HEIs under the Ministry of Education, University Grants Commission Act (UGC), 
the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), and the National Council 
for Teacher Education (NCTE). It will replace fragmented, overlapping regulations 
with a unified, technology-driven, single-window system, substantially reducing the 
compliance burden and delays. Transparent and student-centric systems proposed 
will improve access to quality HEIs, leading to higher GER. The Bill aims to facilitate 
the establishment of globally benchmarked institutions within the country, thereby 
retaining domestic talent and attracting international students and faculty. It will 
strengthen institutional autonomy, especially for Institutions of National Importance42, 
and enable more uniform standard-setting and coordinated growth of the higher 
education ecosystem. 
Developing state capacity to strengthen higher education 
11.27.	 State Public Universities (SPUs) play a crucial role in expanding access to higher 
education and reducing regional disparities in educational opportunities. 495 SPUs 
in the country account for nearly 81 per cent of the total student enrolment in HEIs, 
i.e., about 3.24 crore students at present, with a decadal improvement (from 2011-12 
to 2021-22) of 38 per cent.43 Karnataka leads with 43 SPUs, followed by West Bengal 
and Uttar Pradesh, each with 38 SPUs. Given their scale and scope, improvements in

the quality of SPUs are crucial for India's vision of becoming a global hub of talent, 
knowledge, and innovation.
11.28.	 The Gender Parity Index (GPI) in SPUs stands at 0.93 nationally, with notable 
variation across regions.44 Sikkim leads with a GPI of 1.78, indicating a higher 
proportion of female students in the SPUs. Goa and Haryana follow closely with GPIs of 
1.75 and 1.33, respectively, surpassing the national average. Notably, the GPI in SPUs, 
though lower than the national average of GPI across HEIs, has shown a 31 per cent 
improvement over the past decade, indicating an increase in female enrolment in rural 
areas.
11.29.	 States have taken noteworthy initiatives to strengthen higher education.  On 
governance, universities benefit from greater autonomy, simpler procedures, and 
more professional leadership structures, an approach reflected in Gujarat’s Public 
Universities Act 2023. Capacity-building initiatives such as Maharashtra’s State Faculty 
Development Academy help Vice Chancellors, registrars, and senior administrators 
build the skills needed to navigate emerging challenges and strengthen institutional 
management. Alumni engagement is deepened through structured approaches such 
as Odisha’s Mo College initiative.45 Models such as the Research Parks at IIT Madras 
and IISc (Indian Institute of Scienc) Bengaluru show how structured engagement with 
industry can deepen research quality and foster innovation. Odisha’s Higher Education 
Programme for Excellence and Equity, which institutionalised research internships 
and Centres of Excellence, highlights how targeted interventions can expand student 
opportunities and industry connections. 
11.30.	 A well-functioning innovation ecosystem depends on strong and continuous 
interaction between government, industry, and academia.46 These linkages enable 
the creation, diffusion, and application of new knowledge, forming the basis for 
technological progress. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) 
education provides the scientific and analytical skills needed for innovation. The full 
benefits appear only when research connects closely with industry to develop and 
commercialise new technologies. Strengthening these links is crucial for knowledge 
spillovers, faster technology adoption, and turning scientific progress into productivity 
gains. Box XI.5 discusses policy strategies to enhance industry-academia integration in 
STEM education.

Box XI. 5. Industry-academia integration in STEM education
The NEP aims to integrate vocational training with general education and to encourage 
collaboration between industry and academia within HEIs. Industry-academia linkages in 
the higher education sphere have traditionally emphasised research collaborations, such 
as joint research, consulting, and technology transfer. However, this can be broadened to 
include teaching-oriented university-industry collaborations. These include co-creation and 
co-development of curricula, offering industry-led value-added courses, establishing labs 
with industrial tools, and upgrading faculty competencies. Teaching collaborations help 
reduce information gaps and strengthen graduates’ domain-specific skills through hands-
on learning and project-based engagement. It also promotes problem-solving, technological 
application, and product development, integrating the on-field industry insights from 
distinguished experts.47
Recent data shows a significant gap between industry requirements and the industry-ready 
institutes in India, with a recent TeamLease Edtech report showing that 75 per cent of HEIs 
lack industry-readiness. This is reflected in placement outcomes, with only 16.7 per cent of 
HEIs achieving 76-100 per cent placements within six months of graduation. Only 25 per cent 
of HEIs make use of live industry projects, while 26 per cent have internship integration.48 
Compounding these challenges, as of 31 January 2025, 56.2 per cent of professor posts 
remain vacant in Central Universities and other HEIs.49  
Strengthening industry-academia collaboration offers a potential pathway to address these 
structural constraints and improve graduate employability. Recognising this, the government 
has undertaken several initiatives to deepen industry engagement in higher education. One 
such measure is the introduction of the ‘Professor of Practice’ (PoP) category at HEIs by 
the UGC and the AICTE.50,51 The PoP concept allows industry professionals to bring real-
world practices and experiences into the classroom and also augment faculty resources in 
HEIs. This enables institutions to formally engage eminent professionals to contribute to 
experiential learning, research, training, skilling, entrepreneurship, extension activities, 
and mentoring. According to the UGC PoP portal, over 18,000 experts have registered as 
PoP at 536 institutes.52
However, challenges remain, such as a lack of motivation among industry leaders to 
join academia due to short tenure (typically up to three years, extendable to four), the 
disqualification of retired academicians from applying as PoP, and rather strict eligibility 
criteria for appointment. These are areas which can be further reformed.

Complementing this, the AICTE-Industry Fellowship Programme aims to bridge the gap 
between academia and industry through active faculty engagement. By immersing faculty 
members in cutting-edge industrial environments, the programme seeks to equip them with 
modern industry insights, fostering their ability to deliver industry-relevant education. This 
initiative will eventually improve students' employability and industry readiness. As a pilot 
project, the scheme will train 350 faculty members in the 2025-26 academic year, with plans 
to expand to 1,500 participants annually over 3–5 years.53
In addition, the Indian Science Technology and Engineering facilities Map (I-STEM) serves 
as a national web portal for sharing R&D facilities.54 The portal connects researchers with 
resources by enabling them to access existing publicly funded facilities, promoting indigenous 
technology development, and facilitating collaboration.  It also allows researchers to share 
details of their outcomes, including patents, publications, and technologies. As of 2025, 
approximately 53408 researchers are registered in the I-STEM portal, and more than 30144 
instruments have been uploaded by over 3745 institutes across India.55
Together, these initiatives aim to strengthen the long-term sustainability of industry-
academia linkages by enabling greater, more open, and more active participation by industry 
professionals.
11.31.	  Over the years, the NIRF ranking has expanded in scope, focusing more on 
qualitative variables and now influences funding, institutional support, and academic 
autonomy. It signals student and employer perceptions of quality. The NIRF 2025 data 
shows South India and Delhi have a concentration of top-ranked institutions, while 
northern and central states lag, with few in the top 100.56 Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh 
are represented, but other large states have minimal presence. Emerging institutions 
in northeastern states and UTs are gradually appearing.57 The process promotes data 
governance in HEIs, aiding benchmarking and strategic planning, and informs national 
policy and sector analysis.
11.32.	 The competitive spirit enforced by the rankings has given rise to the need 
for increased accountability of HEIs to learners and employers.  With the evolving 
modes of content delivery, traditional HEIs now compete with edtech platforms also. 
As the quality of content and delivery becomes the primary metric of performance, 
it also becomes the measure for performance-linked funding, shifting the traditional 
institution-centric funding to learner-centric support, where learners are directly

Internationalisation of Higher Education 
11.33.	 NEP aims at ‘Internationalisation’ of higher education by making the Indian 
education system self-reliant and comparable to global standards and norms, enabling 
it to attract more students from abroad and reduce outbound student migration.  UGC 
issued the Regulations on Academic Collaboration between Indian and Foreign Higher 
Educational Institutions, 2022, enabling Indian HEIs to offer twinning, joint, and dual 
degree programmes with reputed foreign universities. Further, 100 per cent foreign 
direct investment (FDI) is allowed in higher education. These efforts are reinforced 
by the UGC (Setting Up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational 
Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, under which 15 foreign HEIs are expected to 
set up campuses in India.58
11.34.	 With state-of-the-art infrastructure and advanced academic standards set 
up through the Higher Education Funding Agency, the World-Class Institutions 
Scheme59, and global rankings reflect its aim to become a global higher education 
hub. Internationalisation extends beyond collaborations and exchanges to recruiting 
international faculty, enrolling foreign students, and fostering an overseas research 
partnerships ecosystem. Box XI.6 outlines policy measures to promote international 
student mobility.
Box XI.6:  Promoting international student mobility
Globally, the stock of internationally mobile students has risen from about 22 lakh in 2001 to 
69 lakh in 2022, with the USA, Canada, UK, Australia, France, and Germany as the principal 
hosts.60 Within BRICS, Russia and China have emerged as major education hubs, together 
accounting for over four-fifths of inbound mobility into the bloc, while India’s share remains 
in single digits despite its very large domestic higher education system.

India has emerged as the world’s largest source country of international students. The 
number of Indians studying overseas is rising from 6.85 lakh in 2016 to over 18 lakh by 
2025.  In 2024, for every one international student coming to India, 28 Indian students 
went abroad, with significant associated foreign exchange costs. Annual outward remittance 
under the ‘studies abroad’ component has increased to USD 3.4 billion in FY24. Indian 
students abroad are highly concentrated in a small group of host countries, including 
Canada, the USA, the UK, and Australia, whose attractiveness is driven by perceived quality, 
work rights, migration pathways, and strong branding.62 
Inbound students in India increased from under 7,000 in 2000-01 to around 49,000 in 2020, 
just before the pandemic; however, this represents only about 0.10 per cent of total higher 
education enrolment, far below leading host countries where international students form 10-
40 per cent of enrolments. State-wise, earlier hubs such as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have 
seen declines in international student enrolment, while Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and 
Andhra Pradesh have emerged as hosts, suggesting that sub-national policies, institutional 
capacity, and outreach significantly shape inflows.63 Thirteen programmes account for 
over 1,000 foreign students each, led by the Bachelor of Technology, Bachelor of Business 
Administration, and Bachelor of Science, underscoring India’s particular strength in cost-
effective English-medium STEM and management education. India remains the principal 
host within South Asia, attracting over four-fifths of all inbound students to the sub-region 
in 2023, largely from neighbouring countries such as Nepal, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and 
Bhutan. However, India’s South Asian share has fallen by several percentage points since 
2011, indicating rising competition from other regional and extra-regional destinations and 
signalling the need to refresh its regional value proposition.64

Domestically limited international visibility of most institutions and regulatory frictions 
have limited India’s ability to convert its cost and scale advantages into an equivalent pull 
factor.65
Policy levers and education tourism
India’s policy ecosystem for internationalisation has become more enabling, with the 
introduction of the NEP, updated UGC guidelines, regulations for academic collaboration 
and mutual recognition of qualifications, and permissions for foreign branch campuses, 
including those in GIFT City. The ‘Study in India’ initiative leverages quality benchmarks, 
including NAAC66, NIRF, IoE67, NBA68, and global rankings, to create a compelling 
proposition for international students. This directly advances an education-tourism strategy 
that capitalises on India's distinctive strengths: its rich traditions in philosophy, Ayurveda, 
classical arts, and spirituality, combined with affordability, widespread English proficiency, 
and a rapidly advancing innovation and digital ecosystem. 
However, to position India as an education hub, broader strategies need to be deployed. 
Programme diversification beyond full degrees, such as summer schools, semester-abroad 
modules, heritage and philosophy tracks, yoga and Ayurveda certificates, and innovation 
or rural-immersion labs, can be bundled with tourism circuits and tailored for BRICS and 
wider Global South partners. Promoting reciprocal student mobility by establishing bilateral 
agreements, alongside encouraging top Indian HEIs to institutionalise two-way exchange 
programmes and offer joint, dual, or twinning degrees can be considered. Institutional 
and ecosystem reforms are necessary to enhance the campus experience (housing, health, 
counselling, insurance, and visa services). These reforms should simplify regulations 
(faster visas, post-study internships, recognition of prior learning, and flexible credits) and 
leverage alumni and start-up ecosystems through embassies and incubators, while building 
regional networks in STEAM3 areas (STEM, including Arts, Management, and Medicine). 
Given the increasing visa and enrolment restrictions in the advanced countries, it is a timely 
opportunity for India to develop a tailored branding, communication, and outreach strategy 
to attract inbound students to India.69
The Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme, of the Ministry of External 
Affairs, has trained more than two lakh persons from over 160 countries in both the civilian 
and the defence sector. It has been an important tool in strengthening India’s cultural 
diplomacy and influence, especially in the South Asian region. Building an education 
ecosystem that provides international students, especially from the global south, with 
opportunities for education and research of global standards at affordable costs will lay the 
foundation for generational goodwill.

Internationalisation of education is the foundational step towards encouraging talent 
retention and migration into India. The competition from campuses of international 
universities can further incentivise Indian HEIs to advance standards and quality. Caution 
must be heeded to the working of market forces that might lead to a general increase in 
the cost of education, excessive commercialisation or exclusion of marginalised, as also to 
the risk of overemphasis on borrowed knowledge systems that may undermine indigenous/
local traditions. The limitations of the existing regulatory framework may spill over, leading 
to more complexities in governance. 
Building on existing initiatives, a measured focus on internationalisation can enhance the 
international mobility of students to India. Strengthening the quality, accessibility, and 
global alignment of India’s higher education ecosystem would develop India as a global hub 
for education and research.
HEALTH: STRENGTHENING PUBLIC AND PREVENTIVE 
HEALTHCARE
11.35.	 Complementing progress in education, enhancements in public health are 
equally important for strengthening human capital and economic productivity. India 
has made significant gains in healthcare over the last decade, improving life expectancy, 
reducing fertility rates, and decreasing maternal and child mortality rates through the 
implementation of effective strategies and policies. Since 1990, India has reduced its 
maternal mortality rate (MMR)70 by 86 per cent, far exceeding the global average of 48 
per cent.71 Similarly, a 78 per cent decline in the under-five mortality rate (U5MR)72 was 
achieved, surpassing the global reduction of 61 per cent and a 70 per cent decline in the 
neonatal mortality rate (NMR)73 compared to 54 per cent globally during 1990-2023.74
11.36.	 The infant mortality rate (IMR)75 marked a drop of more than 37 per cent over the 
past decade, declining from 40 deaths per thousand live births in 2013 to 25 in 2023.76 
Several states, including Karnataka, and Himachal Pradesh, have halved their IMRs 
over the past decade, marking substantial gains in health outcomes. Kerala, Manipur, 
Sikkim, and Goa have an IMR in the single digits, comparable to that of developed 
nations. This marks improvement in the state of neonatal and maternal care, as well as 
overall healthcare and socioeconomic conditions.

11.37.	 These improvements stem from concrete interventions: strengthened neonatal 
care protocols, expanded immunisation programmes, and the systematic establishment 
of neonatal intensive care units across government hospitals. Most infant deaths 
occur within the first month of life, making reductions during this period a significant 
achievement. While significant improvements have been made, moving forward, policy 
must focus on identifying region-specific barriers and targeted interventions to address 
disparities and continue reducing the national IMR.
11.38.	 India has harnessed digital technologies to build integrated healthcare and 
insurance systems that enhance transparency, minimise fragmentation, and expand 
access. A study of ICT interventions under the PM Jan Arogya Yojana scheme reported 
that the interventions have advanced the creation of a robust digital health ecosystem 
aligned with national performance goals.77 The ICT innovations have meaningfully 
supported the achievement of universal health system reforms. Initiatives, such as the

India’s epidemiological transition
11.40.	 India is in a critical and complex stage of the epidemiological transition87. 
While the classical model of transition describes a linear shift from infectious to non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) (Omran A., 197188), India’s path is more nuanced and 
overlapping. Over the past few decades, the country has experienced a substantial

87 	The demographic transition refers to the shift from high to low birth and death rates as societies modernise, 
while the epidemiological transition describes the change in leading causes of death from infectious diseases to 
chronic, non-communicable conditions.

Q. 1971; 49:509–38 https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.2307/3349375
	
Omran’s epidemiological transition theory describes three stages of societal development: an initial phase 
marked by high and volatile mortality from famine and epidemics; a transitional phase of declining infectious 
diseases and rising life expectancy; and a later phase dominated by degenerative and man-made diseases as 
mortality declines slowly.

decline in mortality from infectious diseases and an increase in life expectancy at birth 
from 49.7 years in 1973 to 70.3 years in 2023. However, it still faces a double burden: 
persistent communicable diseases (CDs) (e.g., tuberculosis, vector-borne infections) 
coexist with rapidly rising NCDs like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. 
Recent data show that NCDs account for more than 57 per cent of all deaths in the 
country.89

11.41.	 This duality of rising burdens of CDs and NCDs is compounded by regional and 
socioeconomic disparities. While Kerala exhibits health profiles similar to developed 
countries, dominated by degenerative diseases, certain other states still face issues of 
malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks. 
11.42.	 Cardiovascular diseases have been the leading cause of death for both men and 
women, with a higher proportion in males across all years since 2004-06.90 Other major 
causes include perinatal conditions, diabetes, and genitourinary diseases. Men are 
found to have higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates compared to women. 
This pattern has been documented across countries in global and regional studies.91 
However, women may have worse prognosis and higher case fatality rates after acute 
cardiovascular events, potentially due to delayed diagnosis or under-treatment92.

11.43.	 Consolidating gains in maternal and child health, while scaling up efforts for 
elderly and chronic disease care, will be critical to keep pace with its demographic 
realities. The dominance of cardiovascular diseases highlights the need for targeted 
prevention and management strategies, with special attention to gender-specific risk 
factors and healthcare access. The higher proportion of ill-defined93 causes in women 
suggest a need for improved diagnostic accuracy and healthcare utilisation among 
females.
11.44.	 Obesity is rising at an alarming rate and is today a major public health challenge 
in India. Driven by unhealthy diets, lifestyle changes, including sedentary lifestyles, 
increased consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), and environmental factors, 
it is affecting people across all age groups and increasing the risk of NCDs such as 
diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension, impacting both urban and rural populations. 
The next section discusses this issue. 
Tackling the obesity challenge
11.45.	 The 2019-21 National Family Health Survey (NFHS) reports that 24 per cent of 
Indian women and 23 per cent of Indian men are overweight or obese. Among women 
aged 15-49 years, 6.4 per cent are obese, and among men, 4.0 per cent are obese. More 
troubling still, the prevalence of excess weight among children under five has risen 
from 2.1 per cent in 2015-16 to 3.4 per cent in 2019-21. According to estimates, over 
3.3 crore children in India were obese in 2020, and it is projected to reach 8.3 crore 
children by 2035.94

11.47.	 UPFs are displacing long-established dietary patterns, worsening diet quality, 
and are associated with increased risk of multiple chronic diseases. A global team of 
researchers worked on the Lancet Series on UPFs and Human Health98, consolidating 
the global evidence demonstrating that high UPF consumption is associated with several 
adverse health outcomes, such as obesity, chronic heart disease risk, respiratory issues, 
diabetes, mental health disorders, etc. The rising use of UPFs imposes a substantial 
economic cost through higher healthcare spending, lost productivity, and long-term 
fiscal strain. Box XI.11 of the Economic Survey 2024-25, presented facts about the 
growth of UPF markets worldwide and in India, along with evidence of their impact 
on various health parameters, including mental health.99 Box XI.7 takes the discussion 
forward and presents potential policy responses.
Box XI.7: Addressing the challenge of ultra-processed foods 
An increase in UPFs in the human diet is contributing to chronic diseases worldwide and 
widening health inequalities. There is a growing body of evidence on the impact of UPFs 
on human health, indicating that there should be no delay in implementing public health 
policies while further research continues to unfold.100 Policies have so far focused on advocacy 
to reduce consumption of foods high in added fats, sugar, and sodium, many of which are 
UPFs. However, improving diets cannot depend solely on consumer behaviour change; it

will require coordinated policies across food systems that regulate UPF production, promote 
healthier and more sustainable diets and marketing.
The marketing challenge: Marketing strategies for UPFs often include explicit 
encouragements for overconsumption, with phrasing such as ‘I bet you can't eat just one’.101 
While noodles utilise emotional selling or ‘buy one get one free’ tactics, as well as celebrity 
endorsements and projecting the UPF as a healthy food option. Such strategies lead to the 
displacement of whole foods and degrade the quality of the diet. Adolescents exposed to 
unhealthy food and beverage advertising showed a high desire and intention to consume 
the advertised foods.102 A study from Punjab found that parents are concerned about food 
advertisements, especially during children's TV viewing time, and celebrity endorsements, 
which they believe may increase the frequency of children eating out.103   
A study from New Zealand found that children’s exposure to unhealthy food/drink marketing 
is linked to their dietary preferences and consumption.104 A recent state-of-the-art review 
report of UNICEF finds strong evidence linking marketing and UPF intake.105
India’s policy response to the rising burden of obesity, NCDs, and increasing UPF 
consumption was documented in 2017 through the National Multi-sectoral Action Plan 
(NMAP) for Control of Common NCDs.  It called for reducing unhealthy diets, considered to 
be a key driver of NCDs, and for reducing high-fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) food consumption 
through several steps and coordinated action across 39 departments. These included 
regulations for Front-of-Pack labelling (FOPL), a ban on advertisements of HFSS foods by 
amending existing laws on the Advertising Code106 and the Norms of Journalistic Conduct to 
explicitly include HFSS foods. It also envisaged a comprehensive law to prevent and control 
NCDs, addressing the marketing and advertising of HFSS and alcohol.  The NMAP had set 
a target to halt obesity by 2025.
The ICMR–NIN Dietary Guidelines (2024) explicitly warn against UPFs and recommend 
limiting HFSS products.  The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) Guidelines for 
Prevention of Misleading Advertisements (2022), and relevant provisions of the Food Safety 
and Standards Act 2006 commit that there shall be no misleading food advertisements.107 
However, enforcement against misleading food advertisements leaves much to be desired.

While Rule 7 of the Advertisement Code prohibits misleading, unverified, or unhealthy 
advertisements, it does not define ‘misleading’ with measurable or nutrient-based criteria, 
leaving interpretation subjective and inconsistent. Similarly, the CCPA guidelines mandate 
that ads must not exaggerate health benefits or exploit children, yet they lack clear nutrient 
thresholds or a framework for identifying misleading claims in food marketing.108 This 
regulatory ambiguity allows companies marketing UPFs to continue making vague ‘health,’ 
‘energy,’ or ‘nutrition’ cues without violating any clearly defined standard, highlighting a 
critical policy gap that needs reform. 
A comprehensive analysis of the policy framework around advertisements by public health 
experts in India concluded that a ‘robust regulatory framework is needed to protect children 
from HFSS food marketing, not just what is “directed” at them, with clear evidence-based 
food classification criteria.’109
The option of a marketing ban on UPFs from 0600 hours to 2300 hours for all media, and 
enforcing restrictions on the marketing of infant and toddler milk and beverages, could be 
explored. Chile is an example of a country with integrated laws. Advertisement restrictions 
are also done in other countries, such as Norway and the UK. Recently, the UK has banned 
junk food advertising before 9 pm on TV and online to reduce children’s exposure and 
curb childhood obesity.110 Further action on other marketing activities, including school 
and college sponsorship of events by UPF manufacturers, can be designed.  The authors 
recommended UPF marketing restrictions to be mandatory and include digital media.
Front-of-pack nutrition labelling: In a unique multi-sector consensus, 29 organisations 
issued a statement reviewing evidence on FOPL. It offers concrete recommendations, 
particularly for replacing the proposed Indian Nutrition Rating (or Health Star Rating) 
system with warning labels, restricting marketing to children, and ensuring that trade 
agreements do not undermine public health policy. 
Studies have shown that warning labels are the most effective option for discouraging 
UPF consumption, compared with ranking-style labelling schemes such as Nutri-Score and 
Health Star Ratings.111,112,113  The authors recommend that warning labels be added to UPFs 
or HFSS foods targeted at infants and toddlers, as these foods are currently not included 
in regulations. Prohibition of nutrient and health claims on UPFs is also recommended to 
avoid health halo effects.

Nutrient-Based Tax on UPFs: The possibility of introducing the highest slab of GST and 
a surcharge on UPFs which exceed thresholds for sugar, salt, or fat could be explored. The 
revenue generated could be earmarked for public health initiatives, including nutrition 
education, school meal improvements, and NCD prevention programmes.
Multi-pronged approach
It is essential to reiterate some key points made in the previous Economic Survey, namely that 
a multi-pronged approach is necessary to address the concerns arising from the increased 
inclusion of UPFs in diets in India.114 The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India 
(FSSAI) may bring UPFs under regulation with a clear definition and standards, including 
stricter labelling requirements. UPF may be defined in addition to HFSS by integrating it 
into the existing frameworks, rather than replacing them. This can be done by using the 
Nova classification or by identifying cosmetic additives. Enhanced monitoring of branded 
products to ensure compliance would help build consumer confidence. It is also crucial to 
raise awareness about the adverse effects of consuming UPFs through targeted campaigns 
aimed at schools and colleges.  
11.48.	 Recognising obesity as a critical public health concern, the government has 
launched comprehensive, multi-pronged initiatives to prevent, manage, and reduce 
obesity in the country. The interventions are strategically designed by multiple 
ministries to promote a holistic approach that integrates health, nutrition, physical 
activity, food safety, and lifestyle modifications (e.g., POSHAN Abhiyaan & Poshan 2.0, 
Fit India Movement, Khelo India, Eat Right India, Nationwide Awareness Campaign – 
‘Aaj Se Thoda Kam’) and AAMs, the School Health Programme, and Yoga promotion 
continue to advance the goal of a healthier, stronger, and obesity-free India. Ministry 
of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) has issued instructions to all states/UTs to take 
action for a 10 per cent reduction in oil consumption and intensify awareness through 
National Programme for Prevention and Control of NCDs (NP- NCD) platforms. Under 
the programme, over 31.5 crore adults have been screened, and 8.47 crore identified 
as overweight or obese. The FSSAI has launched the ‘Stop Obesity & Fight Obesity- 
Awareness Initiative to Stop Obesity’ campaign to prevent obesity and reduce excessive 
oil consumption. As part of the campaign, communication materials to raise awareness 
of obesity have been prepared in regional languages and sign language, alongside media 
outreach through FM radio, railway announcements, and digital platforms.115 Above all, 
it is important for all to focus on the intake of the right nutrition in their diets. The 
following section discusses the need to narrow the nutritional gap while presenting the 
extent of the challenge in this regard.
Nutritional intake trends

child malnutrition; key nutrient deficiencies in adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating

mothers, and micronutrient and mineral deficiencies, especially the vulnerable and 
marginalised sections of society. The concerns of rising lifestyle diseases, rising burden 
of cancers, increasing antibiotic resistance, and falling general immunity levels are 
exacerbated as a consequence of nutritional deficiencies. It is evident that nutrition 
plays a crucial role in addressing many of these concerns. 
11.50.	 Nutritional intake trends set the broader context of India’s progress and 
commitment to achieving SDG 2: Zero Hunger, which focuses on eliminating hunger 
and improving nutrition outcomes. Daily per capita intake of calories and protein has 
increased in both rural and urban areas between 2009-10 and 2023-24 (Chart XI.11).116 
Calorie intakes for rural and urban populations are similar at nearly every income 
level, suggesting a narrowing nutritional gap (Chart XI.12). Additionally, a positive 
correlation has been observed between consumption expenditure and calorie intake in 
both rural and urban India.117
11.51.	 The National Food Security Act of 2013 (NFSA) is one of the largest food 
security programmes globally, aiming to ensure access to food for all. Moving beyond 
food security and to ensure nutrition security, targeted initiatives such as Saksham 
Anganwadi and POSHAN 2.0, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) and 
Poshan Shakti Nirman are being implemented with a focus on improving the nutritional 
status of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating mothers, and school-going children.

11.52.	 At over 1.8 lakh AAMs, community health officers and primary healthcare teams 
deliver services for the prevention and management of malnutrition among children, 
as well as maternal nutrition. The initiative provides screening, early management, 
referral, and follow-up for children's nutritional disorders (deficiencies, overweight/
obesity), along with counselling and support for mothers/caregivers on infant and 
young child feeding. While there are several initiatives focused on nutrition, going 
forward, the policy focus needs to address the underlying factors that influence dietary 
preferences (Box XI.8).
Box XI.8: Nutrition for a future ready India
Initiatives directly targeting nutrition outcomes range from the NFSA public distribution 
measures, the Poshan Abhiyan for children, supplementary nutrition for adolescent girls, 
mid-day meals, to take-home rations for expecting and lactating mothers, both by the 
union and state governments. These are complemented by initiatives/campaigns focused 
on exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding, reproductive health, highlighting 
the benefits of nutrition in the school curriculum, and awareness about lifestyle disease 
prevention, among others. However, the concerns continue to prevail and, in some cases, 
worsen. There is a need to acknowledge the presence of underlying factors that affect 
nutrition, such as diversity and quality of food available, changing socio-cultural patterns of 
consumption, food fads and taboos, and inadequate knowledge about nutrition.
An analysis of food patterns and preferences reveals that a significant segment of the 
population in India consumes far more cereals than recommended, along with less protective 
foods such as legumes, milk, nuts, vegetables, and fruits. For example, in the urban region 
of north India, fat intake (67.3 g) was among the highest; Northeast India consumed the

Economic Survey 2025-26
454
454
highest total calorie (2908 Kcal) and carbohydrate (457 g) per day; highest percent protein 
from meat, poultry, fish and sea foods was observed in the urban (16.9 per cent) and rural 
(28 per cent) of southern regions. Further, only 8.7 per cent of the population in rural areas 
and 14.3 per cent of the population in urban areas consumed milk and milk products as 
per recommended levels.118 Findings from EAC-PM study show that the dietary diversity 
of micronutrient intake has improved significantly over the last decade (2011-12 to 2022-
23) across all consumption classes, with the largest gains observed among the bottom 20 
per cent of households. This improvement further reflects better access to micronutrient-
rich foods, such as fruits, eggs, fish, meat, and milk, enabled by advances in infrastructure, 
transport, and storage, pointing to a meaningful, broad-based improvement in diet quality.119
All first-line interventions, from infancy through adolescence to adulthood, need to be 
strengthened to move from merely targeting accessibility to also focusing on quality 
standards of food and supplements that are delivered and bioavailability, along with 
tracking outcomes. The current interventions and new ones will need to be based on more 
disaggregated evidence on food habits and the prevalence of diseases in the region/state, 
while also considering access to a diverse range of sources. Adopting a whole-of-life approach 
for nutrition interventions enables all implementing agencies to collaborate. Similarly, the 
supply of processed and packaged protein-rich foods, as well as high-quality micronutrient- 
and mineral-fortified foods, can be incorporated into rations, mid-day meals, and other 
meals, ensuring both quality and nutrition. Traditional foods, such as millets and lesser-
known pulses, may be considered for distribution through the public distribution system, 
ensuring that they do not perpetuate reliance on cereals and help widen dietary diversity. 
Further, there is also evidence of significant improvement in dietary diversity across 
consumption classes and states, which is influenced by better infrastructure and access to a 
wider variety of foods.120 The most significant gain in dietary diversity has been reported in 
the bottom 20 per cent of households and the Northeastern states. 
The 2024 ICMR–NIN Dietary Guidelines121 address India's evolving food environment. 
They tackle the dual burden of malnutrition-undernutrition and rising obesity, while 
emphasising sustainable food choices, micronutrient sufficiency, and the prevention of diet-
related NCDs. Key recommendations include consuming a diverse range of foods, increasing 
intake of vegetables and legumes, and reducing consumption of salt, fat, and sugar. The 
guidelines also promote regular physical activity and serve as a vital resource for public 
health policymakers, nutritionists, and the wider public. 
Dietary reforms should be treated as a public health priority and hold a prominent place 
in initiatives for the prevention of NCDs, alongside integration with AYUSH for effective 
management.  The efforts to popularise locally grown food, traditional foods and traditional

cooking methods are reflected in the increasing number of social media influencers creating 
content around such knowledge and practices. The attractiveness and reach of social media 
should be leveraged to disseminate the importance of nutrition in the prevention and 
management of NCDs. Sustained awareness generation and education are possible only 
with a change in behavioural choices, and it can be enabled by embedding the messages in 
a culturally relevant manner.  
11.53.	 Schools serve as formative environments where children learn and adopt healthy 
nutritional and physical activity practices. Considering the amount of time children 
spend at school, it is an ideal place to encourage them to learn and practice healthy 
habits. A study of school-based, family-involved interventions for tackling childhood 
obesity prevention across countries concluded that having teachers actively involved 
and trained by health professionals to coordinate school-based activities is more 
effective in promoting healthy energy-balance-related behaviours during school hours.122 
11.54.	 School-level interventions such as increasing water accessibility, providing free 
fruits, offering only healthy options in the school cafeteria, and removing vending 
machines will provide a choice of healthier foods.  Integrating mandated daily and 
weekly physical activity time with classroom activity is crucial for both mental and 
physical health and will reinforce the benefits.  The formation of a wellness council 
by school staff, along with a written wellness policy, may enhance the effectiveness of 
school-level interventions. Regular training and workshops for parents and staff, and 
collaboration with the local community, will enhance the effectiveness of measures. Any 
intervention at the school level would only be effective with the active participation of 
the families and communities to ensure that healthy habits are followed outside schools 
as well. To incentivise both public and private schools to prioritise student well-being, 
a school well-being score may be calculated. This would allow parents to assess school 
performance based on both the academic achievements and the students' well-being.
11.55.	 Today, the market offers a growing range of products sold as energy drinks, 
health drinks, nutrient drinks, stress-relief formulations, and weight-loss beverages, 
many of which make quasi-medical claims without being considered medicines.  These 
products are known as ‘health supplements’ or ‘nutraceuticals’.  The regulations for 
nutraceuticals are continually evolving, with supplements often occupying a grey area 
between food and medicine. Since these products can be purchased without a doctor’s 
prescription, concerns exist that long-term, unregulated use, particularly of poorly

manufactured products, may lead to adverse reactions. Consumers must be clearly 
informed and educated that such products are not equivalent to clinically validated 
therapies, enabling them to make an informed choice.123
11.56.	 While national nutrition programmes play a vital role in setting the tone of 
the policy framework and extending financial support, it is the states that, through 
successful on-the-ground implementation, determine the efficiency and effectiveness of 
programmes. State-level innovations are powerful tools for addressing local challenges 
and issues. Additionally, social & behaviour change communication (SBCC) strategies 
have been effective in achieving the desired scheme outcomes. These strategies have 
been employed in large-scale health initiatives such as HIV prevention and control, 
polio vaccination, routine immunisation, and COVID-19 vaccination. Similarly, schemes 
such as the Swachh Bharat Mission, Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Programmes, 
and the PM Fasal Bima Yojana have integrated SBC as part of their implementation and 
seen improvements in demand generation and sustained behavioural changes. 
11.57.	 One such state-level example is Rajasthan’s Cash Plus Model, which integrates 
DBT with behaviour change interventions to tackle child and maternal undernutrition.124 
The learnings from the programme can inform implementation strategies in other 
states to better achieve scheme outcomes. Box XI.9 outlines the key lessons learned 
from this model.
Box XI.9: Leveraging social & behaviour change communication: 
Lessons from the Rajasthan Cash Plus Model
The NFHS 5 data showed that in Rajasthan, 31.8 per cent of children under five years of 
age were stunted, 27.6 per cent were underweight, and 16.8 per cent were wasted.125  The 
pandemic severely impacted the delivery of cash transfer schemes targeting maternal 
and child health, including the PMMVY and the state-funded Mukhya Mantri Matritva 
Poshan Yojana. This led to delays in payments and the diversion of funds by beneficiaries 
for purposes other than those intended. In response, the government of Rajasthan launched 
the Cash Plus model.126  
Under this initiative, the two existing cash transfer schemes were converged and piloted in 
five tribal districts.127 The initiative acknowledged that traditional practices, myths, and
123 FSSAI requires that labelling on the article of food shall be in accordance with the Food Safety and Standards 
(Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, and the specific labelling requirements provided in these 
regulations. Nutraceuticals must not claim to prevent, treat, or cure diseases; any health-related claims must 
be scientifically supported and approved, and product labels must clearly identify the item as a nutraceutical, 
disclose ingredients and quantities, provide usage and safety warnings (including ‘NOT FOR MEDICINAL 
USE’), and include storage and precautionary information. https://tinyurl.com/4p58u5xz

deeply ingrained socio-cultural factors influenced food habits and child-feeding practices; 
therefore, it designed a tailor-made SBCC strategy in conjunction with the cash transfer. 
The SBCC strategy clearly segmented the targeted audience and went beyond the primary 
target of pregnant and lactating mothers to reach out to husbands, mothers-in-law, other 
family members, and the larger community with contextualised key messages.128  To 
ensure proper behaviour modification among the target audience, Anganwadi workers 
(AWWs) were trained based on a custom-made AWW guideline, ‘Margdarshika’, to provide 
nutrition counselling during home visits and to conduct group counselling on maternal and 
child health. Simultaneously, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) were trained to provide 
individual counselling to improve understanding of the need for antenatal care.  These two 
interventions were positioned as the primary interpersonal communication approaches. 
ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers organised meetings of Village Health 
Nutrition and Water Sanitation Committees, providing an opportunity to discuss nutrition 
and health issues in these meetings, thereby encouraging community participation. 
Awareness sessions were conducted by frontline workers during community programmes 
such as Godh Bharai and Annaprashan. Multimedia campaigns were used across print 
media, radio, and television channels to create awareness about the scheme and its benefits. 
Mid-media methods, such as street plays, puppetry, and wall paintings, were utilised to help 
retain the key messages. 
Recognising that men mostly owned smartphones and consumed short videos, and 
acknowledging growing social media use among the target audience, digital campaigns 
were used for outreach. The ‘Bahubali’ campaign was developed and shared on Facebook, 
YouTube, and aired on movie channels. It reimagined Bahubali as a caring family man rather 
than a stereotypical ‘manly' figure, featuring a four-part web series on shared household 
responsibility. These efforts promoted positive gender norms and shared nutritional duties. 
The results were encouraging.  Compared to 2022, 54 per cent more women are using cash 
specifically for accessing nutrition, and the proportion of women using cash for food increased 
from 30 to 89 per cent in 2025.129 35 per cent more women have gained over 6 kg during 
pregnancy; 49 per cent more women are using local food items, ensuring improvement in 
dietary diversity, and a more diverse diet is being provided to children above 6 months of 
age.  The SBC strategy has enabled informed decision-making among beneficiaries, shifted 
social attitudes, debunked myths, and encouraged community participation. Between 
2022 and 2025, a 35 per cent reduction in prevalent myths and taboos surrounding 
maternal nutrition and awareness among men increased from 18 per cent to 62 per cent. 
These behavioural change interventions ensured that the financial transfer is utilised by 
the beneficiaries in the desired manner and that the positive practices adopted by them are 
sustained.  
As welfare schemes grow, states must go beyond service delivery to understand behavioural 
factors influencing benefit use. Unlike other schemes focused on uptake, financial transfers 
rely on beneficiaries using aid as intended. Incorporating SBCC as a core, well-resourced

part of programme design can address barriers, improve household decision-making, 
promote gender norms, and dispel myths, ensuring financial support yields desired 
results. A structured, locally-informed SBC approach supported by frontline workers and 
communication channels can foster sustained behaviour change and amplify long-term 
impact.
11.58.	 Just as increased UPF consumption and rising obesity reveal how modern 
lifestyles shape health outcomes, the growing prevalence of digital addiction highlights 
another critical behavioural risk in today’s society. While obesity and inadequate 
nutrition threaten the physical health of youth, digital addiction undermines their 
cognitive and social development. Together, these interconnected challenges necessitate 
policies to safeguard the health and human capital of the next generation.
Digital addiction: Cognitive and psychological impacts

by a rapidly growing digital economy, robust public digital infrastructure and affordable

reflecting near-ubiquitous access and driving digital usage across all demographic 
groups. In 2024, 48 per cent of internet users watched videos online, 43 per cent 
accessed social media, 40 per cent used email and listened to online music, and 26 
per cent made digital payments. In absolute terms, these shares translate into roughly 
40 crore users for OTT (over-the-top) video and food delivery and almost 35 crore for 
social media.131  
11.61.	 Thus, India’s youth are living in an intensely digital environment. While access 
fuels learning, jobs, and civic participation, compulsive and high-intensity use can 
impose real economic and social costs, ranging from lost study hours and reduced 
productivity to healthcare burdens and financial losses resulting from risky online 
behaviours. With near-universal mobile/internet use among 15–29-year-olds, access 
is no longer the binding constraint; the focus needs to shift to behavioural health 
considerations such as the rising problems of digital addiction, quality of content, well-
being impacts, and digital hygiene. 
11.62.	 Digital addiction is described as addictive behaviour linked to digital devices, 
including smartphones, the internet, gaming, and social media addiction (Ali, Jiang

et.al. 2015132; Meng et al., 2022133). It is typically framed as a behavioural pattern of 
excessive or compulsive engagement with digital devices or online activities that leads 
to distress and functional impairment, described as persistent, excessive, or obsessive 
computer and online use, causing impairment in psychology.134
11.63.	 Digital addiction negatively affects academic performance and workplace 
productivity due to distractions, ‘sleep debt’, and reduced focus. It also erodes social 
capital through weaker peer networks, lower community participation, and diminished 
offline skills. Beyond direct economic costs from online purchases, gaming, and cyber 
fraud, it can reduce employability, productivity, and lifetime earnings. Compulsive 
digital use is linked to anxiety, stress, depression, and sleep disturbances, especially 
among students facing academic pressure and exposure to cyberbullying and high-
stimulus platforms.
11.64.	 Research on digital addiction highlights distinct risks and mental health 
consequences among youth. Social media addiction is strongly associated with anxiety, 
depression, low self-esteem, and cyberbullying stress, with multiple Indian and 
global studies confirming its high prevalence among those aged 15-24. Compulsive 
scrolling and social comparison are particularly linked to anxiety and depressive 
symptoms. Gaming disorder shows evidence of causing sleep disruption, aggression, 
social withdrawal, and depression, with adolescent populations especially vulnerable. 
Online gambling and real money gaming present evidence of harm, including financial 
stress, depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Finally, streaming and short video 
compulsion carry evidence linking binge-watching and endless video loops to poor 
sleep hygiene, reduced concentration, and heightened stress. Together, these findings 
underscore the multifaceted nature of digital addiction and its significant impact on 
mental health.
11.65.	 Social connections play a crucial role in the mental well-being of an individual. 
Evidence suggests that frequent face-to-face socialising correlates with higher mental 
well-being.135 The Box XI.10 discusses how social connectedness impacts mental health 
and suicide rates and presents the findings of a study conducted on this aspect.

Aristotle presented a view of friendship with three general characteristics: Utility, Pleasure, 
and Virtue.137 The relationship between companionship and mental well-being has been well 
documented.138 Humans are highly social animals, and our psychological and physical well-
being is strongly related to our social connectedness and integration into social networks.139,140 
and the quality of our close friendships141. Social connectedness not only impacts our hedonic 
well-being (HWB) but is also seen as significantly impacting our eudaimonic well-being 
(EWB).142
It is in this background that a study was done to examine the social connectedness in various 
states in India and how it links with suicide rates. To access a larger and more comprehensive 
dataset and to gain deeper insights, data from the Facebook Social Connectedness Index 
(SCI) was examined143,144,145 and used as a measure of connectedness in a district-level 
geographical unit. SCI measures the relative probability of a Facebook friendship link 
between two Facebook users in different locations.146 The dataset used contains over 60 million 
pairs of linkages between two geographical areas and their corresponding SCI numbers,147 
and those pertaining to India were further distilled down to the state and district levels.148 
To closely approximate in-person connectedness, the focus was placed on the SCI scores for 
connectedness within districts,  since a within-district connection on Facebook is likely to 
have an in-person counterpart as well.149

The SCI was first used by Bailey, Cao, Kuchler, Stroebel, and Wong (2018).150 It measures 
the intensity of social connectedness between users based on location. Users are assigned 
to locations based on their information and activity on Facebook.  The SCI between two 
locations i and j is defined as: 
SCIi,j = (𝐹𝐵_𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑖,𝑗 / 𝐹𝐵_𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠𝑖 ∗ 𝐹𝐵_𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑠j). 
If SCI is twice as large, a given Facebook user in location i is about twice as likely to be 
connected with a given Facebook user in location j.151 The measure adds some random noise 
and rounds off the Index, ensuring the anonymity of the data and preventing any single 
individual or friendship link from being identified. Most studies of this nature typically 
include interviews and interactions with a representative sample; however, such studies by 
their very nature are smaller in scale. 
A plot of the suicide death rate (SDR) against the within-District SCI scores for a panel 
of eight selected states shows a broad reverse correlation of within-District connectedness 
with the SDR, i.e. states having districts with higher connectedness, and thus better in-
person social networks, are generally seen as having lower SDRs [Chart XI.13].152

Connectedness visualised using chord diagrams [Chart XI.14] for the intra- and inter-
connectedness of districts in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu are presented 
below. The size of each chord represents the intensity of the connectedness between the 
geographic units. Fewer chords and relatively bigger arcs or similar-sized arcs indicate 
greater within-District connectedness.

151 While the use of Facebook data has its limitations, given the social-demographic profiles of users, varying levels 
of tele-density, and data consumption, it was nonetheless used to discern some preliminary trends, given its 
large size and reach. Facebook is the largest social media platform globally, with 3.05 billion monthly active 
users worldwide [as of February 2024]; India has the largest number of Facebook users, with 403.4 million 
Facebook accounts as of October 2025 (https://tinyurl.com/mx7j4jnm) It is estimated that the 18-30 age group 
comprises 54.2 per cent of Facebook’s users (https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/facebook-age-demographics#), 
and is therefore relevant for the study.
152 Source: NCRB ADSI Report 2023 We understand that Chattisgarh is an outlier i.e. a State which shows a higher 
level of within-District connectedness yet has a high suicide death rate. The reasons would perhaps require a 
deeper dive.

Bihar and Uttar Pradesh display notably sparse chord networks ([Chart XI. 14a & b), with 
thick, concentrated arcs within each district, suggesting that their digital social universe 
is primarily rooted and bounded within district-level communities. This sparsity of cross-
district ties suggests that communities remain relatively geographically anchored, relying 
more heavily on local, in-person social bonds and being less dependent on distant, online-
mediated relationships. The SDR for these states is very low, being 0.7 for Bihar and 3.9 for 
UP.  Conversely, Kerala and Tamil Nadu (Chart XI.14c & d) exhibit densely woven networks of 
chords radiating across districts, indicating that their online social fabric is highly dispersed 
and geographically diffuse, and hence lower in person-to-person social connection. This is 
reflected in the relatively higher SDRs of 30.6 in Kerala and 25.3 in Tamil Nadu.

Note: It may be noted that in the above visualisations, the size of the arcs is dependent 
on the number of districts in the state. Therefore, arcs for a state like UP with a higher 
number of districts would be narrower as compared to a state like Kerala, which has fewer 
districts.

India’s challenge is to rebalance youth engagement by combining restrictive safeguards 
with positive offline opportunities and not to demonise technology. That balance respects 
the role of technology in modern learning and work while addressing the overloads that 
harm sleep, mood, attention, and finances, ensuring that we can mitigate economic losses, 
protect mental health, and maintain digital progress as a driver of empowerment rather 
than addiction.
Global and national responses to digital addiction
11.66.	 Digital addiction among youth has become a significant public health concern 
worldwide, prompting regulatory, therapeutic, and educational responses from 
governments, health institutions, and civil society. The World Health Organisation 
(WHO) recognised online gaming addiction as a mental health condition in ICD-11 
under ‘Gaming Disorder,’ defined by impaired control over gaming, prioritisation of 
gaming over other activities, and continued play despite negative consequences.153
11.67.	 Australia has introduced one of the world’s strictest measures against youth 
digital addiction, a nationwide ban on social media accounts for children under 16. 
South Korea introduced the ‘Shutdown or Cinderella law’ in 2011, restricting minors 
from accessing gaming websites after midnight. This policy, grounded in the Game 
Industry Promotion Act, was later repealed in 2021 in favour of parental control 
models.154 China has implemented a ‘fatigue system’ for gaming that restricts online 
gaming time (just one hour per day on weekends and holidays) and penalises overuse, 
enforced through real-name registration systems.155 Singapore has taken a community-
based approach through its Media Literacy Council, which promotes responsible digital 
citizenship and cyber wellness across schools and public platforms.156 In the United 
Kingdom, the Digital Resilience Framework provides schools, policymakers, and tech 
companies with tools to embed digital resilience into education and product design.157 
Countries, including South Korea, Brazil, France, Spain, Finland, Australia, Japan, 
and some U.S. states, are restricting student smartphone use through classroom bans, 
school-wide limits, or curfews to curb distractions and protect student well-being. The 
Seoul Metropolitan Government launched ‘I Will Centres’ to prevent addiction and 
offer recovery counselling, promoting a healthy internet culture for the city's youth.158

India’s response to digital addiction
11.68.	 In India, multiple measures address digital addiction among children. The CBSE 
has issued guidelines on safe internet use in schools and school buses.159 The Ministry 
of Education’s Pragyatah framework guides digital education planning with attention 
to screen time160, while the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has 
issued guidelines on screen-time limits and online safety.161
11.69.	 Tele-MANAS (Tele Mental Health Assistance and Networking Across States), 
launched by the MoHFW in October 2022, offers a 24/7 toll-free mental health helpline 
(14416) across all states and UTs, connecting callers to trained professionals at no cost. 
A Tele-MANAS app launched in 2024 further expanded access. The service has received 
over 32 lakh calls since its launch, reflecting its relevance and impact.162 The SHUT 
(Service for Healthy Use of Technology) Clinic at NIMHANS, Bengaluru, provides 
specialised care for excessive and compulsive technology use, focusing on adolescents 
and young adults. It also conducts free online sessions for parents to support healthier 
screen-time practices.163  
11.70.	 The Online Gaming (Regulation) Act, 2025, represents a major step to address 
digital addiction and financial harm among youth. It bans online money games involving 
wagering, restricts advertising, and introduces a licensing framework for permissible 
skill-based games to curb compulsive use, debt, and related mental health concerns.164
Way forward
11.71.	 A major challenge in addressing digital addiction in India is the lack of 
comprehensive national data on its prevalence and mental health effects. This hinders 
targeted intervention, resource allocation, and integration of digital wellness into 
national mental health strategies. The upcoming Second National Mental Health Survey 
(NMHS), led by NIMHANS and commissioned by MoHFW, is expected to generate 
empirical and actionable insights into the prevalence of mental health issues in the 
Indian context.
11.72.	 Developing a comprehensive set of indicators is essential to assessing the 
multidimensional effects of digital addiction interventions. Key metrics may include 
usage patterns (average recreational screen time), health outcomes (sleep quality,

anxiety and stress levels), academic and workplace performance (attendance and task 
completion), and safety concerns such as cyberbullying, online scams, and exposure to 
real-money gaming.
11.73.	 Digital addiction also affects adults. Awareness programmes in colleges and 
workplaces, technology-free zones, and ‘buddy’ or ‘mentor’ systems can promote 
healthier digital habits and build offline connections. Adults may be encouraged 
to adopt ‘digital diets’ involving voluntary device-free periods. For severe cases, 
community-based, device-free spaces can provide professional support. Karnataka’s 
‘Digital Detox Centre - Beyond Screens’  serves as a resource hub for individuals facing 
digital addiction.165
11.74.	 To provide alternatives to digital spaces, governments and communities should 
establish offline youth hubs, particularly in urban slums and rural areas. Recognising 
that digital access cannot be fully restricted, moderated online safe spaces hosted by 
schools or similar institutions can also offer peer support and verified mental health 
resources supervised by trained facilitators. Schools play a critical role in shaping 
digital habits and should introduce a Digital Wellness Curriculum covering screen-
time literacy, cyber safety, and mental health awareness. Measures such as cyber-
safety drills, peer mentor programmes, and mandatory daily physical activity can build 
resilience. Dependence on online teaching tools, which expanded during COVID-19, 
should be reduced in favour of offline engagement.
11.75.	 Families should be educated and encouraged to promote screen-time limits, 
device-free hours and shared offline activities. Parental workshops should be provided 
through schools and community centres to train guardians in setting healthy boundaries, 
recognising signs of addiction, and using parental control tools effectively. Policies 
on age-based access limits may be considered, as younger users are more vulnerable 
to compulsive use and harmful content. Platforms should be made responsible for 
enforcing age verification and age-appropriate defaults, particularly for social media, 
gambling apps, auto-play features, and targeted advertising.
11.76.	 Promoting simpler devices for children, such as basic phones or education-only 
tablets, along with enforced usage limits and content filters, can further reduce exposure 
to harmful material, including violent, sexual, or gambling-related content. Network-
layer safeguards, such as ISP-level interventions, can complement such measures by 
offering family data plans with differentiated quotas for educational versus recreational 
apps and default blocking of high-risk categories, with opt-in overrides available to 
guardians.
