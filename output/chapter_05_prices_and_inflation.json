  "summary": [
    "ANCHORED This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of recent trends in global and domestic inflation, with a particular focus on the period up to December 2025.",
    "Globally, inflation has moderated significantly from its post-pandemic highs, with advanced economies stabilising at 2–3 per cent and emerging markets, including India, experiencing a notable decrease in the rate of inflation. The moderation is attributed to easing commodity prices, particularly in food and energy, as well as responsive monetary policies by central banks. India stands out for achieving a sharp decline in headline inflation, alongside robust GDP growth, reflecting strong macroeconomic fundamentals and effective monetary policy.",
    "Domestically, retail inflation (CPI) has followed a clear downward trajectory, reaching 1.7 per cent in 2025–26, driven primarily by a steep decline in food prices—especially vegetables, pulses, and spices—supported by favourable agricultural conditions and timely policy interventions. Core inflation, while appearing sticky, is shown to be largely influenced by surges in precious metals; when these are excluded, underlying inflationary pressures are more subdued. The analysis highlights the critical role of government interventions in stabilising food and edible oil prices.",
    "The chapter also explores sectoral price dynamics, noting a long-term decline in the terms of trade for manufacturing relative to agriculture, which has implications for resource allocation and investment. On the other hand, regional inflation patterns reveal greater volatility in rural areas due to higher food weights in consumption baskets. However, overall, state-level inflation outcomes have converged within the Reserve Bank of India's tolerance band, with few exceptions. The Chapter also examines the drivers of divergence in state-level inflation experiences.",
    "Looking ahead, the outlook remains favourable, with projections of inflation staying within target ranges, supported by strong agricultural output, stable global commodity prices, and continued policy vigilance. However, risks from currency fluctuations, base metal price surges and global uncertainties persist, warranting ongoing monitoring and adaptive policy responses."

A recent study has also highlighted the significance of wage rates in increasing inflation disparity across the states.5 Our further analysis demonstrated that the state-level inflation rates show a significant positive association with wage rates, state-level GDP growth rates and COVID impact (indicating inflation increases with the increase in wage rate and GSDP growth rate, and that COVID had a structural step-up influence on the price situation). However, the share of industrial output showed some negative association with the state-level inflation, reflecting the benign effect of supply- side efficiencies in manufacturing sector in dampening price pressures. GST imposition was found to be price neutral for state-level inflation differential. Variables such as weighted average lending rate, fiscal deficit ratio and credit intensity do not exhibit a robust independent association with inflation once state-specific and year-specific effects are accounted for in the 10-year duration. The share of agricultural output, did not seem to have a meaningful impact at the local level for the 10-year duration under study as production structures may be oriented more to national and export markets rather than flooding the local markets.6 While the present results highlight important associations, they should be viewed as indicative rather than definitive, and need more comprehensive study incorporating a broader set of explanatory factors and their dynamics."
