    "NEXT India's journey toward Viksit Bharat hinges on inclusive growth and upward social and economic mobility for every citizen. The development model of India is based on the principle of leaving no one behind. The government is working towards this goal through multiple initiatives focused on enhancing education and healthcare, the core pillars of human capital and overall well-being.",
    "In the education space, progress in school and higher education has been at the back of enhanced quality and access through community engagement, effective assessments, improved accountability, and stronger alignment between education and skill requirements. Building state capacity in higher education, fostering academia-industry collaboration, and expanding global engagement can further enhance the education system’s responsiveness to the changing needs of the economy. Health outcomes have improved through infrastructure expansion and targeted policies. Emerging challenges, such as obesity, the rising burden of non-communicable diseases, and the psychological effects of digital exposure, require a stronger focus on preventive care and behavioural change strategies. This chapter presents good practices in dealing with emerging challenges from various parts of the country, offering valuable lessons for others to learn from. Enhancing education and healthcare through integrated, accountable, and adaptive policy frameworks is essential to building a future- ready workforce."

Recognising that digital access cannot be fully restricted, moderated online safe spaces hosted by schools or similar institutions can also offer peer support and verified mental health resources supervised by trained facilitators. Schools play a critical role in shaping digital habits and should introduce a Digital Wellness Curriculum covering screen- time literacy, cyber safety, and mental health awareness. Measures such as cyber- safety drills, peer mentor programmes, and mandatory daily physical activity can build resilience. Dependence on online teaching tools, which expanded during COVID-19, should be reduced in favour of offline engagement."
