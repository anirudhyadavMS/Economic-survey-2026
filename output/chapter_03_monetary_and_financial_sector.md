emerging trends in State-level debt and deficits underscore the need for continued 
calibration. The recommendations of the Sixteenth Finance Commission will play a 
critical role in shaping Centre-State fiscal relations, influencing the quantum and 
composition of resource transfers, and thereby affecting State-level fiscal outcomes. At 
the same time, the increasing reliance by some States on unconditional cash transfer 
programmes has altered expenditure composition, raising concerns about expenditure 
rigidity and medium-term fiscal flexibility. While such transfers serve important 
distributional objectives, their scale and design need to be balanced against the 
imperative of preserving space for growth-enhancing investments. Improved targeting, 
periodic review, and outcome-oriented design can help mitigate fiscal rigidities.
2.57	From a macro perspective, any fiscal indiscipline at the State level also casts a 
shadow on the sovereign borrowing costs. With markets pricing government debt 
on a consolidated basis, persistent revenue deficits or an expansion of committed 
expenditures at the State level could affect sovereign bond yields. This underscores the 
importance of coordinated fiscal discipline across levels of government, where fiscal 
policy is oriented toward expanding productive capacity and income growth rather 
than creating permanent expenditure commitments. Strengthening the fiscal capacity 
of local bodies, in line with constitutional intent, can also help improve expenditure 
efficiency and investment outcomes at the grassroots level.
2.58	Looking ahead, ongoing reforms in taxation, including GST 2.0 and personal 
income tax, are expected to enhance the efficiency of the tax system by simplifying 
structures, reducing compliance costs, and broadening the tax base, with implications 
for both economic activity and revenue mobilisation. In parallel, wider use of digital 
systems in tax administration and public financial management is likely to strengthen 
compliance, improve expenditure disbursements, and enhance fiscal transparency. 
Together, these measures will enable progress along the medium-term debt path, 
thereby strengthening macroeconomic stability.

MONETARY MANAGEMENT AND 
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION: 
REFINING THE REGULATORY 
TOUCH
India's monetary and financial sectors have exhibited robust performance in 
FY26 (April-December 2025), underpinned by strategic policy actions and 
structural resilience across financial intermediation channels. In response to 
moderating inflation, the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee 
reduced the repo rate, while injecting durable liquidity through cash reserve 
ratio cuts and open market operations. These measures have been effectively 
transmitted to lending rates, with the weighted average lending rates of 
scheduled commercial banks declining. The banking sector has simultaneously 
strengthened its fundamentals, with gross non-performing asset ratios declining 
to multidecadal lows and profit after tax increasing, signalling improved asset 
quality and profitability.
Capital formation has been particularly robust in primary equity markets. 
Household financial savings have increasingly shifted towards equities and 
mutual funds, with the share of equity-linked instruments in annual household 
savings rising, reflecting the deepening financialisation of domestic savings. 
Financial inclusion has advanced substantially through digital public infrastructure, 
fintech lending, and government-led microcredit initiatives. India’s first 
international financial service centre at GIFT City is creating an enabling ecosystem 
for attracting and channelling global capital. Significant strides have been made in 
providing social security cover to citizens in terms of pension and insurance.  
While India’s financial system is becoming more resilient, diversified, and 
inclusive, it faces new challenges emanating from dynamic forces. These 
challenges incude the need to improve regulations, manage the use of AI in 
finance, and scale up to meet the demands of a growing, aspirational population. 
This necessitates that the regulatory authorities navigate prudently to reconcile 
growth with stability.  
INTRODUCTION
3.1	 Monetary management and financial intermediation are fundamental pillars of 
the economic structure, driving growth, stability, and financial inclusion. Monetary 
management, led by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), involves regulating the money

supply, interest rates, and liquidity to ensure price stability while supporting sustainable 
economic growth. It also directly influences financial stability. Effective policy 
transmission through the banking and financial sector ensures that changes in interest 
rates and liquidity conditions are efficiently transmitted to businesses and households. 
This stability is crucial for sustaining growth and preventing financial crises, as a stable 
financial system enables the smooth allocation of resources and fosters economic 
resilience in the face of global and domestic shocks.
3.2	 The vastly interconnected global financial architecture of today was built and 
developed in the era of rapid globalisation. Globalised finance has led to lower borrowing 
costs, greater access to capital, and improved international risk sharing.1 However, in 
the presence of rapid geopolitical fragmentation, the financial sector has become a 
channel for the transmission of global shocks. Thus, emerging markets face the task of 
leveraging the benefits of globalised finance and simultaneously minimising the costs 
that stem from volatile shocks. In this context, regulatory innovation, transparency, and 
accountability are crucial for addressing the challenges of an uncertain era. Moreover, 
tapping into innovative and inclusive channels of domestic finance is necessary, as 
these can serve as a buffer against shocks to volatile global finance and simultaneously 
advance the goals of growth and development.
3.3	 This chapter outlines the trends in India’s financial sector against the backdrop 
of these global developments. The chapter begins with an exploration of trends in 
the global financial sector. Subsequently, the next section provides a comprehensive 
overview of key developments in the monetary sector in India. This is then followed by 
sections which cover various aspects of the financial sector, including banking, capital 
and debt markets, foreign portfolio investments, pensions, and insurance.  In view of 
the agile responses demonstrated by regulators across the financial sector, the chapter 
places specific emphasis on regulatory achievements and on the role of financial sector 
regulators in maintaining stability while identifying areas requiring improvement. The 
chapter concludes with a financial sector outlook, highlighting the key challenges that 
lie ahead.
GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS – UNCERTAINTY AND 
OTHER EMERGING RISKS
3.4	 Financial markets are typically the first to register and absorb the impact of an 
uncertainty shock. Much before agents across government, trade, and households adjust 
their choices, financial market participants tend to respond by pricing in uncertainty

risk in real time. The year 2025 was marked by heightened uncertainty, which had a 
palpable impact on financial markets.
3.5	 The first half of calendar year (CY) 2025 saw the global financial markets reacting 
to the tariff announcements by the US government. Global policy uncertainty increased 
following the announcement, prompting investors to reduce their exposure to the US 
Dollar (USD) and seek safe-haven assets, such as gold. Global equity markets dipped, 
and risk premiums rose across asset classes in April 2025. (Chart III.I). Subsequently, 
financial market volatility subsided and returned to normal once some of the US 
government's announcements were reversed.

3.6	 The impact of uncertainty on financial markets is not just limited to a rise in 
volatility and risk premia. Research shows that prolonged periods of uncertainty can 
affect the financial sector through at least three key channels. First, financial market 
participants are seen to defer decisions in the presence of uncertainty (via the real 
options channel). A rise in uncertainty will trigger a ‘wait-and-see’ sentiment, delaying 
investments and capital formation (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994).2 Second, heightened 
uncertainty can raise the cost of finance through a rise in credit spreads (Manzo, 2013) 
2	 Dixit, A. K., and R. S. Pindyck. (1994) Investment under Uncertainty. Princeton University Press.

and financial intermediation costs (Francis, Hasan & Zhu, 2014).3,4 In turn, this can 
impact the real economy by impeding the flow of credit. Finally, prolonged uncertainty 
can increase the possibility of sharper market corrections across asset classes.5 In some 
cases, these market corrections can pave the way for financial contagion, spreading to 
the entire financial sector and the real economy.
3.7	 In addition to the above risks, global financial markets grapple with the impact 
introduced by new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). The IMF’s Financial 
Stability Report (FSR) of October 2025 notes that there is a higher likelihood of herding 
behaviour in financial markets, as global investors use similar AI models. The report also 
notes that, compared to previous decades, investors have become increasingly sensitive 
to micro-information signals transmitted through social media. These trends suggest the 
possibility of longer and more amplified shocks in global financial markets.  Parallelly, 
technology stocks pose an emerging risk of inflated valuations, with AI-related stocks 
accounting for 75 per cent of S&P 500 returns, 80 per cent of earnings growth, and 
90 per cent of capital spending growth since ChatGPT launched in November 2022.6 
At the same time, as noted by the IMF, structural vulnerabilities such as rising global 
government debt and aggressive risk-taking among non-bank financial institutions 
remain capable of intensifying the effects of emerging shocks.7  At the same time, digital 
assets such as the Stablecoin are gaining traction and playing a larger role in financial 
intermediation. As of 31 December 2025, the total market capitalisation of stablecoins 
stands at USD 305.4 billion, marking a 49.6 per cent increase this year.8 Stablecoins' 
rising market capitalisation and increasing interconnections with the traditional 
financial system have reached a stage where potential spillovers to that system can no 
longer be ruled out. 
3.8	 Amidst such uncertainties, it is relevant to understand whether and how firms’ 
investment decisions are affected. Box III.1 empirically estimates the impact of 
prolonged periods of uncertainty on capital formation by firms in India.

Box III.1: Capital formation amidst uncertainty shocks - 
a study of listed firms in India
Uncertainty shocks have become a defining feature of the present era. While these shocks 
are essentially geopolitical in nature, they also stem from technological shifts and policy 
changes. This box seeks to understand how capital formation choices of firms in India 
respond to such shocks. 
Literature establishes that firms delay investment in the presence of uncertainty due to 
factors such as increased costs of financing (Christiano et al., 2014)9  and a rise in the ‘option 
value’ of delaying investment (Dixit & Pindyck, 1994).10 However, in some scenarios, firms 
may choose to invest despite an uncertain environment. For example, firms in strategic 
sectors may invest in R&D despite economic uncertainty, anticipating higher future payoffs 
(Weeds, 1999).11 Similarly, factors such as asset size, market power, market concentration, 
and growth opportunities impact a firm’s choice to invest irrespective of uncertainty.12 Given 
this heterogeneity, a detailed exploration is warranted to understand how firm investment 
behaviour in India responds to uncertainty shocks.
There is a wide variety of literature that attempts to model uncertainty, which is, in fact, 
a latent variable that cannot be directly observed. One category of research uses media 
coverage to track the frequency of specific keywords related to uncertainty (See, for example, 
the widely used Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index by Baker and Bloom).13 A second 
category frames uncertainty based on qualitative data from forecasters. A third category 
quantifies uncertainty as a residual, unobserved variable that varies over time.14  
Data and model 
The present study covers 811 listed firms in India for the period from 2010 to 2024.15 The 
sample comprises a heterogeneous mix of large (63 per cent), mid-sized (28.7 per cent), and 
small firms (8.3 per cent), operating across diverse sectors ranging from infrastructure and 
mining to retail and wholesale distribution. Nearly 25 per cent of the firms exhibit a strong

export orientation.16 The study period encompasses several significant shocks, including the 
taper tantrum (2013), the twin balance sheet crisis (2016–2018), the COVID-19 pandemic 
(2020–2021), and heightened global geopolitical tensions (2022–2023).
Uncertainty is modelled as a common unobserved shock affecting all firms at time t. The 
study employs a panel SVAR framework (Pedroni, 2013), which offers several advantages 
for the data under consideration.17 First, it accommodates unbalanced firm-level panel 
data. Second, it accounts for potential endogeneity among variables. Third, it captures 
rich information from a wide cross-section (N = 811) despite the relatively short time 
dimension (T = 15).
The impact of uncertainty shocks on capital formation is estimated using the following firm-
level equation, where i = 1 to 811: 
               Kit=f ( Πit Liquidityit, Borrowingsit,)
Where  Kit refers to capital formation, which is captured by the change in net fixed assets of 
the firm i at time t; Π(it) refers to the profits after taxes, Liquidityit is taken as the ratio of cash 
and bank balances as a share of total assets, and Borrowingsit is captured by reported firm 
borrowings. These variables are selected based on firm-level literature on capital formation 
dynamics (Dhasmana, 2025).18  
The model treats uncertainty as an unexpected, common shock to profits across all firms 
in the sample. Firms respond to this shock heterogeneously, as reflected in their individual 
impulse response functions for capital formation. The 811 individual impulse responses 
are then studied to construct an overall picture of firm-level capital formation following an 
uncertainty shock. 
Findings of the study
The main variable of interest - capital formation- is standardised by taking it as a share of a 
firm’s total net fixed assets (NFA). This allows for easier interpretation at an aggregate level. 
The standardised variable is thus defined as the change in NFA as a share of total NFA (Ki/
NFAi) where Ki is capital formation following an uncertainty shock and NFAi is a firm’s latest 
NFA position (as of 2024).
The study reveals that an uncertainty shock, on average, induced firms to undertake negative

studied.

Pedroni’s Panel Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) framework captures the heterogeneity of large N, 
small T samples without introducing any bias into the estimations. Furthermore, it is suited for unbalanced 
panels and helps model uncertainty as a common latent shock variable across firms. Specifically, using Pedroni 
2013’s SVAR framework, uncertainty is modelled as follows:  
                                                                                          єit=ηi єt +μit  
where єt is the white noise shock for an endogenous variable of firm i at time t, which is expressed as the sum of 
a common shock єit and an idiosyncratic firm-specific shock μit.

capital formation, i.e., reduce 0.51 per cent of their net fixed assets over five years - although 
the impact varies significantly across firm characteristics. Categorisation of the firms by 
size, export orientation and sector reveals the following: -
(i)	 By size19: Large firms (top decile) reduced 0.5 per cent of their NFA on average, while 
mid-sized firms showed the steepest decline at 4.7 per cent. As opposed to mid-sized 
firms, small firms proved to be more resilient, reducing their net fixed assets by only 1 
per cent.
(ii)	By export orientation: Export-intensive firms reduced 1 per cent of their net fixed 
assets, while non-exporters largely halted capital expenditure.
(iii)By sector: Transport equipment manufacturers showed robust capex relative to their 
NFA following an uncertainty shock. Manufacturers of light-tech products, such as 
leather (0.79 per cent of NFA), beverages (0.62), wood products (0.42), and rubber 
and plastics (0.17), registered moderate capital expenditure improvements amidst 
uncertainty. In contrast, technology-intensive firms, such as machinery (-0.49) and 
electrical equipment (-0.46), registered a moderate decline in capital expenditures 
following an uncertainty shock. Even so, other tech-intensive sectors such as chemicals 
(0.06) and pharmaceutical manufacturers (0.21) displayed consistent investment 
despite an uncertainty shock. 
	
Services sector firms within categories such as civil engineering (8.51), consultancy 
(0.33), advertising (0.28), and retail trade (0.26) showed healthy capital expenditure 
following a shock.
As a robustness check, the uncertainty shocks reported by the model are compared to 
the EPU index for India between 2010 and 2024. The chart below illustrates the changes 
in uncertainty shocks and the corresponding changes in the EPU over time.20 The two 
measures show a good degree of correlation (78 per cent). Both measures spike during the 
years of the twin balance sheet problem (2016-2018), the pandemic years (2020-2021) 
and in the presence of heightened geopolitical shocks (2022-2023). This shows that the 
model correctly gauges uncertainty before estimating its impact on capital formation 
across firms.
19	 Firms are separated based on size, depending on their relative ranking (amongst other listed firms) in terms of 
assets and sales over the past three years.
20	While the EPU measures policy-related uncertainty, the model’s estimates reveal the uncertainty experienced 
by firms. It may be noted that while policy uncertainty may be a sufficient condition for firms to experience 
uncertainty, it is not a necessary condition, i.e., firms may experience uncertainty shocks in the absence of policy 
uncertainty. For instance, a sectoral demand shock may trigger an uncertainty response for firms even in the 
presence of a stable policy environment.

Inferences
In the absence of causality testing that accounts for other firm attributes, no inference can 
be made regarding the relationship between asset size and firm uncertainty. Nevertheless, 
the correlation between firm size and capital formation indicates that mid-sized firms in 
the sample were more vulnerable to uncertainty shocks than firms in the top or bottom 
deciles of the asset distribution. This may be because large firms can absorb shocks using 
internal resources, while small firms can leverage their agility to continue investing despite 
uncertainty. Mid-sized firms, in contrast, lack both the flexibility of small firms and the 
resource buffer of large ones.
As most of the shocks observed between 2010 and 2024 were of a global nature, the model 
indicated that exporter firms are more likely to reduce capital formation in the presence of 
an uncertainty shock compared to their domestic counterparts.
The impact of uncertainty is heterogeneous at a sectoral level. Traditional and medium-
technology sectors displayed continued capital formation despite an uncertainty shock. The 
services sector, too, broadly held up to an uncertainty shock, as evidenced by sectors such as 
civil engineering, consultancy, and market research. In contrast, high-tech manufacturing 
firms, barring a few exceptions, cut back on capital formation. This is evidenced by the 
literature, which shows that manufacturing firms tend to experience intense uncertainty 
due to factors such as long gestation periods, higher irreversibility, and input supply 
disruptions.21

Policy approaches aimed at reviving private capital formation must therefore explicitly 
account for uncertainty and its uneven sectoral effects, specifically for sectors that intensely 
experience uncertainty shocks. Reviving private capital expenditure in such areas requires 
buffering sector-specific uncertainty by enhancing predictability through deregulation and 
simpler, more stable laws and frameworks. 
MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS 
3.9	 India’s approach to monetary management balances macroeconomic objectives 
with social goals. By maintaining price stability, supporting financial stability, and 
promoting inclusive growth, monetary policy acts as a key enabler of sustainable 
development and economic prosperity in the country. 
3.10	In the light of the evolving macroeconomic and financial developments outlined 
in the previous section, the RBI undertook several key monetary policy actions in FY26 
(April-December). These measures were designed to support economic growth while 
maintaining price stability. In response to the easing inflation, the RBI’s Monetary 
Policy Committee (MPC) cumulatively reduced the repo rate by 100 basis points during 
its meetings from April to December 2025. As of December 2025, the repo rate stands 
at 5.25 per cent. These reductions were aimed at boosting credit flow, investment, and 
overall economic activity. Furthermore, in consideration of the prevailing and expected 
inflation-growth dynamics, the MPC's stance was changed from accommodative to 
neutral in June 2025. This neutral stance has been consistently maintained since then, 
allowing the MPC the flexibility to respond to economic conditions as necessary. 
3.11	 The RBI also announced a 100-bps reduction in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 3.0 
per cent of net demand and time liabilities, implemented in a staggered manner during 
September-November 2025. This decision is expected to release approximately ₹2.5 
lakh crore in primary liquidity into the banking system by December 2025.22
3.12	The trends in the monetary aggregates reflect the impact of the RBI’s policy actions 
on the economy. As of 31 December 2025, the reserve money (M0) growth,23  i.e., the 
monetary base, stood at 2.9 per cent, compared to 4.9 per cent as of 27 December 
2024. This declining trend does not signal a tightening of the liquidity conditions, since 
adjusted for the first-round impact of the change in the CRR,24 the M0 growth stood at 
9.4 per cent, compared to 6.2 per cent a year ago. Therefore, the declining trend reflects

the impact of the CRR cut, which led to a reduction in bankers' deposits with the RBI, 
resulting in a decline in the growth of reserve money. The CRR-adjusted Mo reflects the 
true expansionary stance of monetary policy. On the component side, the currency in

3.13	During the same period, broad money (M3) growth, including the impact of the 
merger of a non-bank with a bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 12.1 per cent, as 
compared with 9 per cent a year ago. This trend in the broad money growth indicates 
that the banks have effectively leveraged the liquidity released by the CRR cut. In terms 
of components, aggregate deposits with banks, which are the largest component of 
M3, were the primary drivers of M3's growth. Notably, the aggregate deposits with the

stood at 6.21 vis-à-vis 5.70 a year ago. When adjusted for the reverse repo/standing 
deposit facility (SDF), which is analytically akin to bankers’ deposits with the central 
bank, the adjusted MM stood at 6.0. The upward trajectory of the MM indicates 
improved financial intermediation by the banking system, thereby ensuring adequate 
systemic liquidity.

Liquidity Conditions 
3.15	 Along with the 100-bps cut, the RBI also injected durable liquidity of ₹2.39 lakh 
crore through nine Open Market Operations (OMO) purchases during April-May 2025. 
Furthermore, in light of the evolving liquidity conditions and outlook, the RBI conducted 
OMO purchases of ₹1 lakh crore and a 3-year USD/INR buy-sell swap of USD 5 billion 
in December to inject durable liquidity into the system. As a result, system liquidity, 
as measured by the net position under the liquidity adjustment facility (net LAF), was 
on average in surplus of about ₹1.89 lakh crore during FY26 (up to 8 January 2026), 
significantly higher than ₹1,605 crore in FY25. Reflecting surplus liquidity conditions, 
banks’ recourse to the marginal standing facility (MSF) declined while their deployment 
of surplus funds under the SDF increased. Borrowings under the MSF declined to an 
average of ₹2,244 crore in FY26 (as of 8 January 2026) from ₹6,902 crore in FY25. 
Concomitantly, the deployment of funds under the SDF increased to an average of ₹1.74 
lakh crore in FY26 (up to 8 January 2026) as compared with ₹0.94 lakh crore in FY25.   
3.16	Throughout FY26, the RBI remained agile in its liquidity management, ensuring 
that adequate liquidity was maintained in the banking system. This proactive approach 
facilitated effective transmission to the money and credit markets, meeting the 
economy’s productive requirements. As a result, the weighted average call rate, which 
serves as the operating target of monetary policy, generally remained below the policy 
repo rate during FY26, averaging 8 basis points below it (up to 8 January 2025).

3.17	 Monetary policy transmission to lending and deposit rates of scheduled commercial 
banks (SCBs) has been robust amid surplus liquidity conditions. In response to the 
100-bps cumulative cut in the policy repo rate, the weighted average lending rates 
(WALR) of the SCBs declined. During April-November 2025, the WALR of SCBs on 
fresh rupee loans decreased by 64 basis points, standing at 8.71 per cent in November 
2025. Similarly, the WALR of SCBs on outstanding rupee loans has decreased by 56 
basis points over the same period, standing at 9.21 per cent in November 2025, reaching 
its lowest level recorded since September 2022.
FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION
3.18	Financial intermediaries implement monetary policy by transmitting the central 
bank’s decisions on interest rates, liquidity management, and credit supply to the real 
economy. Central banks set policy rates and conduct market operations, while financial 
intermediaries adjust lending and deposit rates, influencing spending, investment, 
inflation, and financial stability.
3.19	Financial intermediation in the Indian economy is carried out by a diverse set of 
institutions, including banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), microfinance 
institutions (MFIs), capital markets, and digital fintech platforms. These entities 
mobilise savings, channel credit, manage risks, and enable efficient transactions, thereby 
bridging the gap between savers and borrowers. The country’s financial intermediation 
landscape has undergone rapid digital transformation, with innovations such as the

scoring expanding access to financial services, particularly in rural and underserved 
areas. This section discusses the trends in the functioning of various intermediaries and 
regulatory developments.
Performance of the banking sector
3.20	The stability of the banking system in the country can be attributed to strong capital 
buffers, low non-performing asset ratios (NPAs), and increasing profitability. The 
favourable balance sheets of the SCBs bode well for the overall health of the economy. 
A significant improvement has been observed in the asset quality of SCBs, as evidenced 
by their gross non-performing asset (GNPA) ratio and net NPA ratio, having reached a 
multi-decadal low level and record low level, respectively. At the same time, the capital-
to-risk-weighted-asset ratio (CRAR) of the SCBs remained strong at 17.2 per cent as of 
September 2025.

3.21	Furthermore, this improvement in asset quality has been observed across broad 
economic sectors. The GNPA ratio for the industry decreased from 2.3 per cent in 
March 2025 to 1.9 per cent in September 2025. For services, the ratio decreased from 
2.0 per cent to 1.8 per cent, and for personal loans, it decreased from 1.2 per cent to 1.1 
per cent. In contrast, the GNPA ratio for the agriculture sector remains relatively higher 
at 6.0 per cent in September 2025 and has improved marginally from 6.1 per cent in 
March 2025.  However, the share of this sector in total GNPA has increased from 34.6 
per cent to 36.3 per cent over the same period.

3.22	The recovery rate in NPAs26 in SCBs has approximately doubled from 13.2 per 
cent in FY18 to 26.2 per cent in FY25. The slippage ratio of SCBs, which measures 
the amount of new accretion to NPAs during the FY as a percentage of standard loans 
and advances as at the beginning of FY, has also improved from 7.1 per cent in FY18 
to 1.4 per cent in FY25 and further to 1.3 per cent in FY26, as of September 2025. 
The recovery rate through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC/Code) has 
improved from 28.3 per cent in FY24 to 36.6 per cent in FY25. Through the SARFESI, 
it has improved from 25.4 per cent in FY24 to 31.5 per cent in FY25. 
3.23	Concurrently, the profitability metrics of SCBs are as follows. Their profit after tax 
increased by 16.9 per cent (YoY) in FY25 and by 3.8 per cent (YoY) by September 2025. 
The return on equity for SCBs has experienced a marginal decline from 13.8 per cent 
in March 2024 to 13.6 per cent in March 2025; however, it has maintained a steady 
upward trend since March 2020. On the other hand, the return on assets has remained 
stable at 1.4 per cent in March 2025, consistent with the level recorded in March 2024. 
As of September 2025, these metrics stand at 12.5 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively. 
3.24	In FY26, a moderation in bank credit growth was observed across major sectors 
compared to the same period last year, though recent months have shown an uptick. 
As of 31 December 2025, the (YoY) growth in outstanding credit by SCBs increased to 
14.5 per cent compared to 11.2 per cent in December 2024. December 2025 marked 
the highest YoY growth rates for both bank credit and non-food credit in FY26 (up to 
December 2025).

3.25	In terms of sectoral deployment of non-food credit, among the categories of 
agriculture and allied activities, industry, services and personal loans, the highest 
YoY growth has been observed in personal loans, with an increase of  12.8 per cent in 
November 2025. A significant factor contributing to this growth is a substantial rise in 
loans against gold jewellery, which have increased by 125.3 per cent (YoY), likely due to 
the increasing prices of gold.

3.26	While the YoY growth trend in credit for industry and services has demonstrated 
a moderate increase in FY26 thus far, within industry, the bank credit to the MSME 
sector continues to show momentum and remains robust. In November 2025, bank 
credit to this sector increased by 21.8 per cent compared to a 13 per cent increase in 
November 2024. Within the MSME sector, the credit extended to the micro and small 
enterprises has registered an increase of 24.6 per cent (YoY) in November 2025, up 
from 10.2 per cent in November 2024. 
3.27	Certain regulatory measures, such as revised guidelines on voluntary pledge 
of gold and silver jewellery as collateral for small business loans, have helped in 
improving credit flow to the MSME segment. Furthermore, measures announced in the 
Union Budget 2025-26, such as a significant enhancement of credit availability with 
guarantee cover for MSMEs, the introduction of credit cards for micro-enterprises, and 
others, have also been beneficial to the sector. The revision in MSMEs classification, 
wherein investment limits and turnover thresholds have been substantially raised, also 
contributed to this high growth.27,28 
3.28	Between FY20 and FY25, there has been a notable increase in the overall flow of 
resources to the commercial sector, demonstrating a compounded annual growth rate 
(CAGR) of 20.9 per cent. This flow has increased from ₹13.6 lakh crore in FY20 to ₹35.1 
lakh crore in FY25.29 This upward trend has continued into FY26, with the overall flow 
of resources to the commercial sector amounting to ₹30.8 lakh crore in April-December 
2025, registering an increase of 44.7 per cent (YoY). 
3.29	As of 31 December 2025, within the overall flow of financial resources to the 
commercial sector, there has been a increase in the flow from non-bank sources, which 
have risen by 23.8 per cent (YoY), while the non-food bank credit has experienced a 
growth of 58.6 per cent (YoY).

3.30 Further within the non-bank sources, foreign sources have experienced a greater 
YoY increase as compared to the domestic sources. In FY26, as of 31 December 2025, 
while the former have experienced a growth of 38 per cent, the latter have experienced 
a growth of 19.1 per cent (YoY). The increase in foreign sources is driven primarily 
by a significant rise in external commercial borrowings by non-financial entities, 
which increased from ₹5 thousand crore to ₹27.7 thousand crore, and foreign direct 
investment (FDI) to India, which increased by 67 per cent (YoY). The increase in 
domestic sources is mainly attributable to a rise in the corporate bond issuances by 
non-financial entities, which have experienced a 263.3 per cent (YoY) growth. The 
foregoing discussion highlights the banking sector's robust performance and resilience.
3.31	It is important to note that a concurrent increase in the flow of financial resources to 
the commercial sector, bolstered by greater non-bank intermediation, has accompanied 
the slowdown in bank credit growth in early FY26. This trend indicates that non-bank 
sources have effectively offset the decline in bank credit. The quicker transmission of 
monetary policy has made market-based financial instruments a feasible source of 
funding for large corporations. Furthermore, as the profitability of large corporations 
has risen over time, their internal resources have become a vital source for business 
expansion.30  Collectively, these factors have led to a reduction in their demand for 
bank credit. Therefore, large corporations are increasingly turning to market-based 
30	RBI’s Monthly Bulletin (August), 2025, https://tinyurl.com/2x2yydj4.

instruments to meet their funding requirements, while MSMEs primarily depend on 
bank credit to fulfil their funding needs. 
3.32	In rural and semi-urban areas, the financial intermediation is primarily conducted 
through Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). These banks provide an alternative channel 
for credit distribution to small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, and 
socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Their main focus areas include agriculture, 
trade, commerce, and small-scale industries in rural regions. The following section 
reviews recent measures implemented to strengthen and streamline the RRB structure, 
as well as their evolving financial performance. 
Performance of regional rural banks
3.33	The government undertook various measures to optimise the resources and 
enhance the performance of the RRBs, such as their consolidation in four phases based 
on the principle of One-State-One-RRB that reduced their number from 196 to 28 as 
of 1 May 2025. Furthermore, the integration of the Core Banking Solution and other 
IT systems of the amalgamated RRBs into unified platforms has been undertaken. 
To establish a unified brand and national identity of RRBs, a common logo has been 
adopted for all 28 RRBs. 
3.34	Due to the above measures, their performance has improved significantly. In recent 
years, the financial health of the RRBs has improved. During FY24, they achieved a 
record consolidated net profit of ₹7.6 thousand crore, followed by a second-highest 
consolidated net profit of ₹6.8 thousand crore during FY25. This slight decline in profit 
can be attributed to the implementation of the pension scheme with retrospective effect 
from 1 November 1993, as well as the payments towards computer increment liability.31 
Moreover, key financial indicators have shown consistent improvement. While the 
GNPA ratio for SCB in the agricultural sector remains relatively high, the asset quality 
of RRBs has shown notable improvement. The GNPA ratio, expressed as a percentage 
of gross advances, decreased from 6.1 per cent in FY24 to 5.4 per cent in FY25, reflecting 
the lowest level in the past 13 years.

3.35	Additionally, credit expansion has contributed to an increase in the consolidated 
credit-to-deposit ratio, which rose from 71.4 per cent in March 2024 to 73.8 per cent as 
of March 2025, the highest level recorded in 35 years. Furthermore, the consolidated 
CRAR of all RRBs reached an all-time high of 14.4 per cent at the end of FY25. It is 
also noteworthy that RRBs have consistently exceeded the priority sector lending 
target of 75 per cent of their adjusted net bank credit over the years, underscoring their 
commitment to fulfilling their foundational objectives.
Major policy actions in the banking sector
3.36	A rise in global uncertainty and geopolitical volatility demands a stable and 
efficient domestic regulatory regime. The RBI has been committed to ensuring 
regulatory certainty and efficiency over time. In this context, its recent measures aimed 
at enhancing these aspects within the banking sector are timely and significant. 
3.37	The RBI issued a policy statement on ‘Framework for Formulation of Regulations’ 
on 7 May 2025 with an objective to standardise the process of making regulations in 
a transparent and consultative manner after conducting impact analysis, as may be 
feasible. It also stipulates a periodic review of regulations, taking into account the 
stated objectives, experience gained through surveillance and supervision, relevant 
court orders, global best practices or standards prescribed by international standard-
setting bodies, the relevance in a changing environment, and the scope for reducing 
redundancies. 
3.38	The public sector banks (PSBs) have launched the credit assessment model (CAM) 

Economic Survey 2025-26

based on the digital footprints32 for MSMEs in 2025. This model will leverage digitally 
fetched and verifiable data to enable automated loan appraisal for MSMEs, utilising 
objective decisioning for all loan applications and model-based limit assessment for 
both existing-to-bank and new-to-bank MSME borrowers. Along with improving the 
ease of doing business for the MSMEs, this model also integrates the credit guarantee 
schemes, such as the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises 
(CGTMSE). Between 1 April and 30 November 2025, over ₹3.2 lakh crore MSME loan 
applications, amounting to more than ₹41.5 thousand crore, have been sanctioned by 
PSBs under the credit programmes of CAM. 
3.39	RBI has also initiated a significant reorganisation of its regulatory instructions, 
a move that signifies a transformative change in its regulatory communication. This 
comprehensive effort involved consolidating over 9,000 existing circulars and guidelines 
into 238 function-specific Master Directions, tailored for distinct categories of regulated 
entities. Additionally, instructions issued by NABARD to RRBs, State Cooperative 
Banks, and Central Cooperative Banks were also consolidated in consultation with 
NABARD. As part of this initiative, the central bank will repeal 9,446 circulars, of 
which 3,809 have been incorporated into Master Circulars, while the remaining 5,673 
have been deemed obsolete. This exercise aims to enhance clarity and accessibility 
while reducing the compliance burden on regulated entities, ultimately supporting the 
overarching objective of improving the ease of doing business.33
3.40	To strengthen the institutional mechanism for review of regulations, the RBI has 
constituted a regulatory review cell with a mandate to review every regulation in a 
comprehensive, objective, and systematic manner, at least once every 5-7 years. The 
cell has been operationalised effective from 1 October 2025. Furthermore, to strengthen 
stakeholder engagement in the regulatory process and leverage industry expertise 
continuously, an independent Advisory Group on Regulation comprising external 
experts has been established. 
3.41	Within the strengthened regulatory governance architecture, the RBI has also 
articulated principle-based guidance for the use of AI. It has introduced a Free AI 
framework for responsible AI, which is designed to foster financial innovation while 
ensuring robust risk management. In this context, Box III.2 discusses the details of the 
framework as well as cross-country usage of AI by central banks.

Box III.2: Artificial Intelligence in financial services: Global trends and 
India’s approach.
Globally, the adoption of AI in finance is accompanied by parallel developments in 
international policy. The World Economic Forum’s white paper on AI in Financial Services 
(January 2025) projects that investments across banking, insurance, capital markets 
and payments business will reach USD 97 billion by 2027, with AI making substantial 
contributions to revenue growth in the forthcoming years through enhanced operational 
efficiency, accuracy and a higher degree of personalisation at scale.34 Further, the AI-
powered alternative credit scoring models promote financial inclusion, particularly in 
developing economies. 
There is a convergence in priorities among central banks as they adopt AI, which includes 
using AI to enhance decision-making, improve operational efficiency, and manage risks 
effectively. However, there is a notable difference in their adoption of specific AI initiatives. 
The use of AI by a few central banks is discussed below: 
The European Central Bank utilises AI to enhance statistics for monetary policy, supplement 
data with sources such as text and images using large language models, and for nowcasting 
and forecasting inflation. It also developed early warning models to identify financial risks. 
It created innovative payment services, such as voice-activated payments, to promote 
financial inclusion and enhance communication, thereby ensuring a better understanding of

EU has developed a comprehensive AI framework through the EU AI Act, providing uniform 
rules and risk-based classification. Singapore adopted a multi-stakeholder approach for 
responsible AI in fintech, ensuring ethical compliance. The UK and US are relying on 
guidance frameworks, letting sector regulators adjust rules as needed. 
Despite these diverse approaches, a shared objective emerges to ensure that AI enhances the 
provision of financial services in a safe and inclusive manner. These global developments 
provide important context and benchmarks for India's trajectory in governing AI in the 
finance sector.
India: RBI’s FREE-AI Framework for Responsible AI40
India’s approach to adopting AI in financial services aligns with the broader goal of 
leveraging technology for inclusive economic development. The country’s unique digital 
public infrastructure lays a foundation for AI integration, aiming to democratise financial 
access at an unprecedented scale. 
Based on detailed surveys, the RBI found that AI adoption in Indian finance is still in its 
early stages, with only approximately 21 per cent of surveyed banks and financial institutions 
implementing or developing AI solutions. Adoption is concentrated among larger banks, 
while smaller urban cooperative banks and many NBFCs face resource constraints, 
including inadequate data infrastructure, limited skilled talent, and insufficient IT budgets. 
Additionally, even among early adopters, the use of AI applications remains basic, often 
focusing on improving process efficiency, customer interactions (such as simple chatbots), 
lead generation, and internal decision support, rather than engaging in complex autonomous 
decision-making. 
The RBI’s FREE-AI is designed to foster innovation while ensuring robust risk management, 
highlighting that these two elements are complementary forces that should be pursued 
together. The framework also supports the India AI Mission, enhancing national AI 
capabilities, and aligns with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, ensuring consistency 
in data governance.
The RBI's framework recognises the importance of trust in mitigating systemic risks and 
preserving consumer confidence. It identifies seven core guiding principles, referred to as 
the ‘Seven Sutras’, to ensure effective AI development, deployment, and governance within 
the financial sector.  These are (i) Trust; (ii) People First; (iii) Innovation over restraint; 
(iv) Fairness and equity; (v) Accountability; (vi) Understandable by design; (vii) Safety, 
resilience and sustainability.
Guided by these principles, the RBI’s FREE AI outlines six strategic pillars for effectively 
implementing its vision. Under the Innovation Enablement Framework, the focus is on 
Infrastructure, Policy, and Capacity Building. This includes developing shared data and 
technology infrastructure to democratise AI access (for example, data lakes or plug-and-
play ‘landing zones’ platforms that smaller firms can leverage), crafting agile policies and

establishing regulatory sandboxes for safe and controlled experimentation, along with 
addressing the AI skill gap. The Risk Mitigation Framework focuses on Governance, 
Protection, and Assurance to create transparent governance structures (like board oversight 
and ethics committees), implement robust protective measures for privacy and security, and 
mandate ongoing monitoring and validation of AI systems to ensure reliability. 
The pillars of the framework provide a structured approach for financial regulators and 
institutions to leverage the benefits of AI while managing associated risks. At the same time, 
this position puts India as a leader in AI governance and presents a model for emerging 
economies, effectively balancing innovation with social responsibility.
Microfinance and financial inclusion
3.42	India’s microfinance sector represents a key channel for advancing grassroots 
development in the country. With 95 per cent women borrowers and 80 per cent rural 
clientele, the sector addresses segments where credit access has historically been limited.
3.43	The sector operates through a diverse institutional structure. As of March 2025, 
NBFC-MFIs held 39 per cent market share by loan outstanding, followed by banks (32 
per cent), small finance banks (16 per cent), NBFCs (12 per cent), and others (1 per 
cent). Microfinance operations span 685 districts across 28 states and 5 UTs, with the 
Eastern and Southern regions accounting for 62 per cent of the outstanding portfolio.41 
3.44	Over the past decade, the microfinance sector has displayed steady growth, with 
active borrowers nearly doubling from 330 lakh in FY14 to 627 lakh in FY25. During 
this period, the gross loan portfolio of MFIs multiplied nearly seven times from ₹33,517 
crore in FY14 to ₹2,38,198 crore in FY25. At the same time, MFI branch networks 
expanded from 11,687 branches to 37,380.42
3.45	The microfinance sector experienced a reversal in growth in FY25, with loan 
outstanding declining by 14 per cent on a YoY basis. The stress reportedly appears 
to have been driven by credit overexposure in the sector, following a rise in pent-up 
demand after the pandemic period.43 In response, the RBI, through its circular (dated 
6 June 2025),44 has taken a proactive measure by reducing the minimum qualifying 
assets mandated for microfinance from 75 per cent to 60 per cent of total assets for 
NBFC-MFIs. This is expected to enable NBFC-MFIs to manage their portfolio risks 
more effectively.45 Critically, stringent guardrails were established by self-regulatory

organisations (SROs)46 in the form of reduced loan limits and caps on overall borrower 
indebtedness. In response to the prompt regulatory action, stress in the MFI sector 
has begun to temper with a reduction in risky assets on a quarterly basis between Q1 
FY26 and Q2 FY26.  Other indicators, such as loan disbursements and solvency ratios, 
showed a steady improvement across the same period.47
3.46	Research suggests that MFIs face certain operational challenges, including the 
limited availability of a primary and standardised approach to assess household income. 
In the absence of alternative cash flow information, household income assessment may 
not always be fully accurate, and MFIs often rely on in-house estimation methods. 
However, this is likely to improve over time as more households come within the 
ambit of digital public infrastructure (DPI) and digital finance, which facilitates better 
generation and availability of cash flow information. MFIs are presently not seen to 
offer tailored credit with differential pricing for different categories. In some instances, 
lending may become more competitive when multiple MFIs serve the same borrowers, 
which may be symptomatic of deeper incentive structures within the MFI system. 
Box III.3 examines the incentive structures that may be contributing to the aggressive 
lending strategies employed by MFIs.  They also often have little visibility over certain 
types of loans, such as gold loans, agricultural loans, and cooperative society credit. This 
can constrain their ability to calculate accurate repayment obligations of the borrower 
at the time of availing credit.48
3.47	While the microfinance sector has evolved significantly over the past decade, 
its continued growth would hinge on strengthening enabling infrastructure (such 
as the tools to assess creditworthiness), ensuring responsible lending practices, and 
continuously strengthening institutional resilience to manage cyclical volatility. 
Box III.3: Microfinance, financialisation, and the need to re-centre  
household welfare in impact investing
Microfinance has been a crucial component of India’s financial inclusion strategy, particularly 
for low-income and rural households, as well as for women borrowers. The sector has 
expanded significantly over the past two decades, supported by institutional formalisation 
and the entry of private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investors. Commercial capital

has enabled MFIs to scale operations, expand outreach, adopt technology, and integrate a 
large number of borrowers into the formal credit system. These gains to financial inclusion 
are substantial and merit recognition.
At the same time, the sector has experienced repeated episodes of stress, including over-
lending, borrower over-indebtedness, and a rise in NPAs. These cycles indicate that rapid 
expansion of credit, when combined with strong financial-return expectations, can create 
vulnerabilities at both the institutional and household levels. They also raise a broader 
question about whether the growing financialisation of the sector has, in some contexts, 
weakened the original balance between social objectives and financial sustainability.
Microfinance was initially conceptualised as a model that aimed to improve household 
resilience, support income stability, and enable gradual asset accumulation. Over time, as 
MFIs became integrated into capital markets, their operating environment increasingly 
reflected the incentives associated with growth-oriented commercial investment. In such 
settings, portfolio expansion, yield metrics, and valuation outcomes may come to dominate 
strategic decisions, while social outcomes remain implicitly assumed rather than explicitly 
measured.
One outcome of this shift has been the use of scale-based ‘impact’ indicators, which are 
easier to report but are weakly connected to household welfare. These include metrics such 
as the number of borrowers reached, size of loan portfolios, share of women borrowers, or 
geographic spread. While useful for describing outreach, such indicators do not capture 
whether borrowers are better off in net terms. In practice, they can unintentionally reward 
more intensive lending, frequent top-ups, and deeper credit penetration, even in contexts 
where household repayment capacity is limited.
A more appropriate approach would require replacing such ‘impact-washing’ metrics 
with indicators that track household-level welfare and financial resilience over time. 
These could include measures of net asset accumulation, stability of cash flows, changes 
in savings balances, reduction in reliance on informal lenders, and incidence of distress 
borrowing during shocks. Tracking debt-to-income ratios, repayment burden perceptions, 
and volatility in household expenditure patterns would provide additional insight into 
whether microfinance is supporting long-term financial health rather than increasing net 
indebtedness.
Where such welfare-linked indicators are used, it becomes easier to identify circumstances 
in which credit expansion may be weakening household balance sheets. Existing empirical 
studies in India already document pockets of over-indebtedness in regions with high lender 
concentration and multiple borrowing.49 Thus, excessive credit intensity, when not matched 
by robust credit appraisal and borrower capacity, can increase vulnerability and lead to 
repayment stress.

The alignment of investment incentives is closely related to this measurement challenge. 
Commercial capital has provided significant benefits in terms of institutional capacity, but 
PE/VC investment structures generally prioritise growth, profitability, and timely financial 
exits. As a result, investment performance is largely assessed through financial indicators, 
including portfolio growth, earnings milestones, and valuation appreciation. Social impact 
is stated as an objective, but its achievement is not always tied to investment outcomes in a 
systematic or verifiable manner.
A more consistent alignment between impact objectives and investor incentives would 
require linking exit decisions and valuations, at least partly, to the achievement of pre-
specified social purpose metrics rather than exclusively to financial performance. For 
instance, investor exits could be conditioned on evidence of sustained household-level 
welfare gains, improved resilience indicators, or responsible credit intensity in borrower 
portfolios. Independent validation of such outcomes over a defined period would strengthen 
credibility and discourage growth strategies that prioritise scale at the cost of borrower 
sustainability.
This approach would also mitigate the risk that pressures to achieve time-bound exits 
lead to accelerated loan growth, expansion into riskier borrower segments, or a dilution of 
underwriting standards. Where exit readiness depends not only on financial metrics but also 
on demonstrable social outcomes, MFIs and investors would have stronger incentives to 
moderate expansion during periods of buoyant credit demand, focusing instead on portfolio 
quality, borrower capacity assessment, and complementary savings or insurance products.
From a policy standpoint, this realignment also has implications for the broader trajectory of 
financial inclusion. The experience of recent years suggests that inclusion defined primarily 
as access to credit may be fragile if not accompanied by improvements in household 
financial buffers. In some instances, easy access to frequent and repeated borrowing may 
displace precautionary savings and increase dependence on debt for smoothing routine 
expenditures. When repayment shocks occur, households may exit the formal credit system 
altogether, weakening the longer-term objective of inclusion.
Strengthening the resilience orientation of the sector would therefore require greater 
emphasis on household balance-sheet outcomes. This could include encouraging MFIs to 
integrate savings and risk-mitigation instruments alongside credit, improving borrower 
suitability assessments, and adopting data-driven mechanisms to detect emerging over-
indebtedness. Impact measurement frameworks could also gradually transition from 
outreach-focused indicators to welfare-linked, household-level metrics, reported regularly 
and subject to independent review.
In summary, commercial capital has played an important role in expanding the reach and 
institutional capacity of India’s microfinance sector. However, the incentives embedded 
in PE/VC investment structures have, in some contexts, encouraged financialisation and 
growth-driven expansion that may not always align with long-term household welfare. 
Re-centring the sector on its original social objectives will require replacing scale-based 
impact metrics with household-level welfare indicators and aligning investor exits and

performance evaluation with verified social outcomes alongside financial returns. Such 
an approach would strengthen the stability of financial inclusion gains and support the 
development of a more resilient and welfare-oriented microfinance ecosystem.
Financial inclusion – trends and structural drivers
3.48	India has made significant strides in financial inclusion over the past decade. For 
instance, the number of adults possessing a bank account doubled between CY 2011 
(35 per cent) and CY 2021 (89 per cent).50 There has also been a sharp narrowing in the 
gaps in financial access (between rich and poor, male and female) over the past decade. 
These structural shifts have been underpinned by two converging forces: regulatory 
innovation through India's digital infrastructure and government-led microfinance 
initiatives. Together, these drivers have expanded both the scale and depth of financial 
inclusion nationwide. The following section examines each factor in detail.
3.49	To advance financial inclusion, the government has introduced several targeted 
interventions. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY), launched in CY 2014, has 
opened 55.02 crore accounts as of March 2025, with 36.63 crore in rural and semi-urban 
areas, establishing foundational savings and transaction infrastructure for previously 
unbanked populations. Building on this account base, credit-focused schemes have 
extended formal lending to underserved segments. The Stand-Up India Scheme offers 
bank loans ranging from ₹10 lakh to ₹1 crore to SC, ST, and women entrepreneurs for 
establishing greenfield enterprises. The PM Street Vendor's Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM 
SVANidhi) scheme, launched in CY 2020, provides collateral-free working capital loans 
to street vendors. The Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), operational since April 
2015, finances micro and small enterprises in manufacturing, trading, services, and 
allied agricultural activities. The operational experience of PMMY and PM SVANidhi 
provides empirical evidence on how graduated micro-credit delivery can foster financial 
inclusion, as examined in Box III.4.
Box III.4: Micro-Credit as a pathway to financial inclusion: Evidence  
from PMMY and PM SVANidhi
Government-led micro-credit initiatives have emerged as pivotal instruments in India's 
financial inclusion architecture, extending formal credit access to segments that have 
historically relied on informal sources of credit. PMMY and PM SVANidhi schemes exemplify 
this approach, targeting micro-entrepreneurs with collateral-free lending designed to seed 
enterprise formation, stabilise livelihoods, and foster graduation into higher credit tiers.

PMMY, launched in April 2015 with the mandate to 'fund the unfunded', has achieved 
considerable scale. By October 2025, the scheme had disbursed over ₹36.18 lakh crore 
across 55.45 crore loan accounts. Significantly, more than 10 crore accounts belong to 
first-time borrowers, underscoring its catalytic role in bringing new entrepreneurs into the 
formal financial system rather than merely refinancing existing businesses. The scheme's 
tiered structure, Shishu (up to ₹50,000), Kishore (₹50,000-₹5 lakh), and Tarun (₹5 lakh-
₹10 lakh), enables credit to grow in tandem with enterprise development. In October 2024, 
Tarun Plus (₹10 lakh-₹20 lakh) was introduced for repeat borrowers with strong repayment 
records, further institutionalising this graduation pathway. Over the past ten years, the 
share of Shishu accounts declined from 92 per cent to 63 per cent, while the Kishore and 
Tarun segments expanded, with average ticket sizes nearly doubling for Shishu loans and 
reaching above ₹7 lakh for Tarun. This compositional shift indicates a maturing borrower 
base that is progressively accessing larger credit facilities.
PM SVANidhi employs a similar graduated credit model for street vendors, a segment 
comprising individuals who were largely excluded from formal financial services. In CY 2023, 
the Indian School of Business (ISB) conducted an impact assessment of the PM SVANidhi 
scheme. Subsequently, a follow-up report was released, which covered 5,130 PM SVANidhi 
beneficiaries across 99 urban local bodies for the year CY 2025. The survey reveals a clear 
progression through loan cycles: while 51.5 per cent remain in the first cycle, 32.3 per cent 
have advanced to the second, and 16.1 per cent to the third, a marked shift from 2023, when 
almost all were first-cycle borrowers. This progression correlates with measurable business 
outcomes. The average annualised business income among SVANidhi borrowers increased 
by 20 per cent between 2023 and 2025, outperforming India's nominal GDP growth of 9-10 
per cent, the MSME Gross Value-Added growth of 16.9 per cent, and the modest 5 per cent 
profit gains previously reported in microcredit studies. Growth varied by cycle: first-cycle 
borrowers recorded 17 per cent income growth compared with 23 per cent among second-
cycle and 24 per cent among third-cycle borrowers. Borrowers who invested in fixed assets 
reported substantially faster income growth, 33 per cent compared to 16 per cent for those 
using loans solely for working capital, indicating that asset creation, while less common, 
yields disproportionately large returns.
Both schemes demonstrate strong inclusivity metrics. Under PMMY, women entrepreneurs 
accessed 69 per cent of all microloans, amounting to ₹13.8 lakh crore across 34.8 crore 
accounts. Reach among historically underserved groups is substantial: ₹3.60 lakh crore 
across 9 crore accounts of SCs, ₹1.33 lakh crore across 3.07 crore accounts of STs, ₹7.4 lakh 
crore across 15.34 crore accounts of OBCs, and ₹3.31 lakh crore across 5.98 crore accounts of 
minorities. For PM SVANidhi, one-third of the beneficiaries are women, 45 per cent belong 
to the OBCs, 17 per cent to SCs, and 2 per cent to STs.
The welfare effects of PM SVANidhi extend beyond enterprise metrics. Improved incomes 
have led to housing upgrades for 39 per cent of households, better food access for 55 per 
cent, more affordable healthcare for 44 per cent, and enhanced educational opportunities 
for 50 per cent. These multidimensional gains demonstrate how access to credit can foster 
broader household resilience. The scheme has also accelerated digital adoption, with usage

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation

107
of digital payments rising from 45 per cent in 2023 to 83 per cent in 2025. Formal credit 
access has expanded correspondingly; 30 per cent of borrowers now hold formal loans in 
addition to their SVANidhi borrowings, compared to just 9 per cent prior to the scheme.51 
Notably, both schemes demonstrate strong repayment performance, validating the 
creditworthiness of segments that have been traditionally deemed unbankable. Under the 
PM SVANidhi scheme, the estimated NPA rate is below 10 per cent, comparing favourably 
with the broader microfinance sector. The primary reasons for missed instalments are 
income disruption and health shocks, suggesting that complementary measures, such as 
affordable health insurance, could further strengthen repayment. Similarly, the NPA ratio 
for PMMY (as a percentage of the total loan disbursed) stood at 3.31 per cent as of June 
2025.52
The evidence from both schemes substantiates a virtuous cycle central to financial inclusion: 
credit access, repayment discipline, enterprise growth, and rising credit demand reinforce 
one another, progressively integrating borrowers into the formal financial system while 
strengthening their economic standing. Under the PM SVANidhi scheme, 66 per cent of 
borrowers expressed the need for additional loans, with average requirements rising from 
₹38,000 in the first cycle to ₹86,500 in the third. This demand-side pull, combined with 
demonstrated repayment capacity, creates the foundation for sustainable credit deepening. 
Banks should take note. There is money on the table, and it is a rational economic response 
to take it.
Together, PMMY and PM SVANidhi demonstrate that well-designed micro-credit 
interventions can effectively integrate underserved populations into the formal financial 
system, generate measurable improvements in livelihoods, and establish the credit 
behaviours that underpin sustained access to finance.
3.50	Regulatory innovation is deepening financial inclusion in India. The account 
aggregator framework, a key DPI pillar, supplies lenders with verified data like 
bank transactions and GST records, enabling lending to underserved and first-time 
credit users. DPI payment interfaces, such as UPI, provide transaction data to assess 
creditworthiness. Box III.5 explores how UPI has driven financial inclusion and become 
a flagship success story.
Box III.5: Can payment infrastructure improve overall financial deepening?
While the expansion of bank accounts is a necessary foundation, it is the effective use of those 
accounts that ultimately determines whether financial inclusion translates into meaningful 
economic opportunity. A growing body of research shows that a public, interoperable 
payment infrastructure can play a catalytic role in this transition by converting basic access 
into active financial participation.

In particular, Shashwat Alok et al. (2024)53  demonstrate how a digital payment layer such 
as UPI bridges the gap between account ownership and access to formal credit by generating 
verifiable transaction histories and sharply reducing transaction costs. Their study shows 
that digital public infrastructure reshapes credit markets by enabling banks and fintechs 
to expand lending across the risk spectrum, with fintechs playing a distinctive role in 
reaching new-to-credit borrowers who were previously excluded from formal finance. 
Regions with affordable internet and widespread bank account penetration experienced the 
strongest credit expansion, underscoring the layered nature of financial inclusion and the 
complementary roles of incumbents and new entrants.
Importantly, the growth in credit linked to digital payments did not come at the cost of higher 
default rates. On the contrary, richer transaction data allowed lenders to better identify 
underserved but creditworthy borrowers, enabling system-wide financial deepening without 
a deterioration in portfolio quality. This evidence highlights the power of publicly provided, 
interoperable infrastructure to support inclusion at scale and to align technological change 
with macro-level financial development.
Survey evidence reinforces these aggregate findings. Dubey and Purnanandam (2024)54 
show that UPI adoption is associated with higher economic output, while Artha Global’s 
2025 survey of 4,800 respondents across Maharashtra and Bihar provides a granular view 
of how digital payments are embedded in everyday economic life. Among users, UPI has 
become a general-purpose payment instrument, with at least 60 per cent using it across 
major transaction categories such as store purchases, peer-to-peer transfers, bill payments, 
and online commerce. Nearly 80 per cent reported using UPI for three or more distinct 
use cases, with broadly similar patterns across gender and rural-urban locations. This 
diversification suggests that once adopted, UPI quickly becomes an integral part of routine 
economic activity.
At the same time, digital payments are best understood as complementing, rather than 
abruptly displacing, cash. Over 90 per cent of UPI users continue to use cash regularly, 
reflecting a hybrid payments ecosystem that mirrors international experience. Rather than 
a simple transition to cashlessness, the evidence points to a gradual, layered evolution in 
which real-time payments expand choice, convenience, and efficiency while coexisting with 
established modes of exchange. 
Despite UPI’s remarkable reach, some access frictions remain, largely reflecting broader 
digital divides rather than resistance to the system itself. Therefore, the next phase of 
inclusion involves deepening digital capabilities, awareness, and confidence so that the 
benefits of UPI are more evenly distributed.
Looking ahead, the long-term sustainability of UPI will depend on aligning incentives 
across the ecosystem to support continued investment in infrastructure, reliability, and risk 
management, while preserving the openness and interoperability that underpin its success.

The zero-cost, public-good design has been central to rapid adoption, particularly among 
small merchants, and has enabled digital payments to become a default option for everyday 
transactions.
Overall, the evidence points to UPI as a cornerstone of India’s financial deepening. Its 
significance lies not only in scale, but in how it has integrated digital payments into routine 
economic life, strengthened the link between access and credit, and created a platform for 
inclusive growth. The next set of priorities are less about whether the model works, and 
more about how to consolidate and extend its gains through complementary investments in 
digital capability and institutional capacity as the system continues to evolve and expand to 
include more users. 
3.51	All the above efforts are reflected in the RBI’s Financial Inclusion (FI) Index, 55 
which measures the country's progress in achieving financial inclusion. It captures data 
on 97 indicators related to banking, investments, insurance, postal, and pension sectors 
across three dimensions: access, usage, and quality. These dimensions are represented 
through three sub-indices, viz., FI-access, FI-usage, and FI-quality.56 The composite FI-
Index value rose to 67.0 in March 2025 from 64.2 in March 2024, with all sub-indices 
registering steady growth.

economic agents, debtors may occasionally encounter difficulties in their endeavours. 
This necessitates the implementation of mechanisms to rehabilitate their financial

financially distressed businesses to be reorganised through a creditor-driven resolution

insolvency regime from 'Group C' to 'Group B' on 3 December 2025.57 The rating agency 
noted that average recovery rates have improved from 15-20 per cent under the pre-IBC 
regime to approximately 30 per cent, while resolution timelines have reduced from 6-8 
years to about 2 years. Secured creditors, in particular, have experienced significantly 
higher recoveries. The Report has also acknowledged the role of judicial reinforcement 
of creditor rights, which have contributed to greater predictability and discipline in the 
resolution process. 
3.54	Out of the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) proceedings closed 
as of September 2025, 57 per cent resulted in going-concern rescue (1,300 through 
resolution plans, 1,342 through appeal/review/settlement, and 1,223 withdrawn under 
Section 12A), while 43 per cent ended in liquidation orders affecting 2,896 firms. Over 
time, the resolution-to-liquidation ratio has improved from 20 per cent in FY18 to 91 
per cent in FY25.58
3.55	From the 1300 cases that resulted in a resolution process, creditors realised ₹3.99 
lakh crore. Creditors recovered 94 per cent of the fair value of resolved businesses,59 
and 170 per cent of what they would have received through liquidation. While the 
haircut relative to fair value was approximately 6 per cent, it was 67 per cent relative to 
admitted claims. The data indicate that resolution, where feasible, delivers significantly 
better outcomes for creditors than liquidation.
3.56	A comprehensive study by IIM Bangalore documents a measurable improvement 
in credit discipline since IBC's enactment.60 The study utilises nearly 6 crore corporate 
loan filings made between 2018 to 2024. As the study finds, the proportion of overdue 
corporate loan amounts relative to total outstanding fell from 18 per cent in 2018 to 9 
per cent in 2024. Further their is a decrease in the average number of days for accounts 
to transition from overdue to normal category and from default to normal category 
during the period 2019 to 2024 (Chart III.12).

3.57	The study observed that financially distressed firms (defined as those with an 
interest coverage ratio below 1 and leverage in the highest quartile) experienced a 3 
per cent reduction in the cost of debt relative to non-distressed firms following IBC 
implementation, suggesting improved credit access for viable but stressed enterprises. 
Further, corporate governance indicators also improved. The proportion of independent 
directors on company boards increased by 2.84 per cent after the implementation of 
the IBC, with distressed firms showing an increase of 2.52 per cent. 
3.58	A subsection of the study examines 51 banks between 2010 and 2024. Controlling 
for bank-specific characteristics, the study observes that IBC implementation is 
associated with a reduction in the Net NPA to Net Advances ratio of approximately 
0.96 per cent. 
3.59	Notwithstanding the structural shifts brought about by IBC, the bankruptcy 
regime still offers scope for significant improvement. Primary among the issues is the 
presence of a binding institutional constraint, leading to insolvency proceedings that 
often stretch beyond their mandated timelines. The Code mandates CIRP completion 
within 330 days, including extensions; actual average duration is 713 days overall and 
853 days for cases closed in FY25. This represents a deviation of over 150 per cent from 
the statutory limit.61

3.60	Compounding the insolvency timelines, the National Company Law Tribunal 
(NCLT) holds a pendency of nearly 30,600 cases (as of March 2025) with an estimated 
clearance time of nearly 10 years at current disposal rates. Such extended timelines 
can trigger value erosion - assets deteriorate, employees depart, customers shift to 
competitors, and supplier relationships break down.
3.61	The institutional constraint is present at the level of the courts as well as at the level 
of the Resolution Professionals (RPs).62 Only 30 NCLT benches handle cases across IBC 
and Companies Act jurisdictions, and RPs are also in short number. Of 4,527 registered 
RPs, only 2,198 (49 per cent) hold active Authorisation for Assignment.
3.62	In light of the extended insolvency timelines, the Pre-Packaged Insolvency 
Resolution Process (PPIRP) was introduced in 2021 to provide a simpler, faster, and 
less costly resolution. However, PPRIP has seen only 14 admissions in four years. The 
reasons behind the low take-up include procedural complexity that is inappropriate 
for the target segment, a lack of awareness among MSME promoters and lenders, trust 
deficits regarding debtor-led processes, and the inability of small enterprises to fund 
the process. 
3.63	Recognising these challenges, the IBC Amendment Bill 202563 proposes a range of 
measures aimed at addressing procedural delays within the system. It also proposes a 
framework for cross-border insolvency proceedings.  While the previous decade offered 
testament to IBC’s legal framework and design, the next phase of IBC should combine 
process reform with a rapid scaling of capacity.
Development in the capital markets
3.64	Capital markets help finance economic growth by channelising savings to 
investments. They are catalysts for wealth creation in the economy. The year FY26, so far, 
has been eventful for the economies and markets worldwide, including those in India. 
In the midst of continuous shifts in trade policies and exacerbated uncertainties, India’s 
equity markets exhibited a phase of measured yet resilient performance, reflecting the 
interplay of supportive policies, macroeconomic conditions and sustained domestic 
investor participation. The imposition of US tariff sanctions, weaker-than-expected 
corporate earnings in Q1 FY26 and foreign capital outflows collectively weighed on 
market sentiment. However, a series of measures, including a personal income tax cut, 
a GST overhaul, easing of monetary policy, and receding inflation, as well as improved 
corporate performance in Q2 FY26, supported the market during the period.

3.65	Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex registered gains of approximately 11.1 per cent and 10.1 
per cent, respectively, during April-December 2025, marking a period of correction and 
consolidation following the robust rally observed in the preceding fiscal year. 
3.66	In comparative terms, India’s equity market performance was subdued relative 
to its global peers such as South Korea (KOSPI), the US’s NASDAQ, Japan’s Nikkei, 
China’s CSI 300 and Singapore’s STI. In India, sectoral trends reflected the broader 
macroeconomic narrative. Financial, capital goods, and consumer-oriented sectors 
outperformed, supported by healthy credit growth and domestic consumption, while 
IT and export-driven segments lagged amid muted external demand. 
3.67	Reflecting the strength of India’s financial ecosystem, the primary markets in 
FY26 (up to December 2025) remained resilient and vibrant, leading the world in initial 
public offers (IPOs) issuances. This strong performance was underpinned by sound 
macroeconomic fundamentals, robust investor participation and the continued fine-
tuning of regulatory frameworks by SEBI, despite global headwinds. India’s primary 
markets continued to attract both domestic and international investors, reinforcing the 
country’s position as a key driver of global capital formation.

instrumental in channelising savings into productive investments, mobilising a total 
of ₹53 lakh crore through equity and debt issuances. Of this, ₹14 lakh crore was raised 
through equity issuances. 
3.69	IPO volumes in FY26 (up to December 2025) were 20 per cent higher than FY25, 
and the amount mobilised was 10 per cent higher than the corresponding period of 
FY25. Listings on the main board, the primary market for established companies 
meeting stricter regulatory and size thresholds, rose from 69 to 94, with the amount 
raised increasing from ₹1,46,534 crore to ₹1,60,273 crore. A notable feature of IPO 
activity in FY26 (up to December 2025) was the prominence of Offer for Sale (OFS) 
components, where existing shareholders sell their stakes rather than the company 
issuing new shares. OFS accounted for 58 per cent of the total proceeds.
3.70	The activity in the small and medium (SME) segment also continued to exhibit 
a buoyant trend during FY26, reflecting sustained investor interest and growing 
confidence in emerging enterprises. The number of SME listings in FY 26 (up to 
December 2025) increased to 217 from 190 in FY25 (up to December 2024). The 
amount mobilised increased from ₹7,453 crore to ₹9,635 crore. Since its inception, 
more than 1,380 companies have been listed on the SME platforms of BSE and NSE, 
cumulatively raising over ₹35,000 crore, highlighting the expanding footprint of India’s 
entrepreneurial base within the formal capital market framework. Of these, around 350 
companies have migrated to the mainboard platform, underscoring the role of SME 
exchanges as a stepping stone for high-potential firms.
3.71	 The sustained mobilisation of resources through primary markets and the widening 
participation of emerging enterprises through SME platforms point to the increasing 
breadth and sophistication of India’s capital markets. As market activity scales up and 
new intermediaries and instruments proliferate, the quality of regulatory governance 
becomes central to preserving market integrity. In this context, the Securities Markets 
Code, 2025, represents an important step towards consolidating the legal framework 
and strengthening the foundations of securities market regulation.
Box III.6: Reinventing Market Regulation: Securities Markets Code, 2025
The Securities Markets Code, 2025 (SMC), was introduced in Lok Sabha on 18 December 2025, 
fulfilling a commitment announced in the Union Budget 2021-22.64 It repeals and replaces 
the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the SEBI Act, 1992, and the Depositories 
Act, 1996, thereby consolidating the fragmented laws governing India’s securities markets. 
The Code spans subjects such as board composition, independence, conflict management, 
transparency, regulatory sandboxing, investor protection, governance of market
64	The Bill has since been referred to a Standing Committee for examination.

infrastructure institutions (MIIs), and ease of doing business. These reforms can be 
categorised into three main clusters.
(1) Mechanisms for the delivery of services
SEBI has quasi-legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial powers. The SMC makes various 
provisions on the manner in which these services are delivered.
Rule-Making: Given SEBI’s wide-ranging quasi-legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial 
powers, the SMC seeks to make rulemaking transparent, consultative, and accountable. 
Regulations must undergo public consultation through the publication of drafts, solicitation 
of comments, and disclosure of feedback. The Governing Board, which must include up to 
six independent members, can alone frame regulations, ensuring that diverse, non-executive 
perspectives shape policy. Reviews of regulations are mandatory, except in cases of urgency.
The governance framework also extends to MIIs’ bylaws, which must align with the Code’s 
objectives, guarantee equal access, prevent market abuse, and promote transparency and 
interoperability. These, too, require public consultation and approval from SEBI. Even 
government-made rules must undergo prior publication.
Adjudication: Historically, SEBI’s interim orders lingered for years, effectively penalising 
individuals longer than warranted. The SMC caps the validity of interim orders at 180 days, 
extendable only by reasoned decisions of designated board members, with a maximum 
limit of two years. Interim measures remain temporary, preventing misuse of prolonged 
enforcement.
Executive Action: The SMC establishes a unified registration and licensing framework 
that covers application, scrutiny, and surrender, embedding due process at every stage. 
Investigations and inspections need written orders, specified time limits, and extensions 
based on recorded reasons. Enforcers must quantify unlawful gains or investor losses to 
ensure accountability. No inspection or investigation may begin more than eight years after 
a contravention, reinforcing fairness and predictability.
(2) Regulatory Governance
The Code places regulatory governance at the centre across three key pillars: 
Board Composition: The SEBI board currently comprises nine members; however, under 
the SMC, the number of members appointed by the central government increases to 15, 
with at least five full-time members. The broader composition ensures diversity of expertise 
across law, economics, and market operations, with at least three members required to 
have experience in securities markets. This blend of professionals is intended to strengthen 
deliberations and internal accountability.
Independence: The Code safeguards SEBI’s autonomy over rulemaking, inspections, 
and enforcement, free from executive interference. It preserves financial and staffing 
independence and codifies institutional safeguards - eligibility standards, fixed tenures, 
removal protections, and post-employment cooling periods that bar immediate work with

Economic Survey 2025-26
116
116
government, intermediaries, or market participants. Such measures preserve both functional 
and perceived independence.
Accountability: Transparency is reinforced through a publicly accessible electronic 
database of regulations, orders, and instructions. SEBI must make its regulations governing 
meetings of the Governing Board public and disclose the decisions of its board. The Code 
also requires regular research, impact assessments, and performance audits of both the 
regulator and the market ecosystem, with mandatory publication of results. SEBI is required 
to periodically review the proportionality and effectiveness of its regulations, preferably 
through independent external evaluations - a standard SEBI already applies to MIIs.
(3) Market Infrastructure Institutions 
For the first time, the Code brings MIIs, stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, 
and others, onto a clear statutory footing, formally recognising them as entities performing 
vital public functions. Previously treated as regulated market utilities, MIIs are now 
positioned as statutory organs of governance with clearly assigned responsibilities. The 
Code permits SEBI to delegate regulatory powers, such as intermediary registration, to MIIs, 
provided they uphold procedural fairness, natural justice, and confidentiality. Decisions 
must be reasoned, and affected parties retain a right to be heard. MIIs may also regulate 
certain classes of market participants, elevating their role from operational to quasi-
regulatory. Under the SMC, MIIs must be registered, not merely recognised, giving them 
statutory existence subject to ongoing supervisory and governance standards. Registration 
confers legal status and establishes accountability mechanisms, including the possibility of 
supersession in cases where governance fails.
Conclusion
The SMC’s framework extends beyond the securities market, serving as a potential model 
for regulatory governance across India’s wider financial and administrative sectors. Its 
principles-transparency, consultation, proportionality, and accountability-could guide the 
creation of other regulators or the reform of existing ones.
By codifying SEBI’s pioneering regulatory model, the SMC cements India’s leadership in 
designing modern financial oversight architecture. If implemented in both letter and spirit, 
it could restore and strengthen trust among regulators, market participants, and investors. 
The ultimate test will be how deeply these governance standards embed themselves into 
everyday regulatory practice and whether they inspire similar transformation across India’s 
regulatory landscape.
Broadening retail participation in capital markets

through simplified KYC processes and strong regulatory oversight have collectively 
contributed to this expansion, thereby financializing savings from traditional channels 
to formal financial assets. Findings from SEBI’s Investor Survey 2025 further 
underscores this transformation, as nearly 63 per cent of the households surveyed are 
aware of at least one securities market product.65
3.73	During FY26 (till December 2025), 235 lakh of demat accounts were added, pushing 
the total count beyond 21.6 crore. A key milestone was the crossing of the 12-crore mark 
for unique investors in September 2025, with nearly a fourth of them being women. 
The mutual fund industry also expanded, with 5.9 crore unique investors as at the end 
of December 2025, of which 3.5 crore (as of November 2025) were from non-tier-I and 
tier-II cities, underscoring the diffusion of financial participation beyond traditional 
urban centres.  Box III.7 examines the evolution of household financial savings over 
time in the country.
Box III.7: Evolving patterns of household financial savings in India
The composition of household financial savings in India has undergone a significant shift over 
the past decade, indicating a deeper reconfiguration in how households allocate incremental 
financial resources. This transition has been marked by a gradual but persistent movement 
towards market-linked instruments, particularly equities, reflecting both structural changes 
in the financial system and evolving household risk preferences. Equity investments, which 
were once ancillary to household balance sheets, have increasingly become a significant 
component of financial wealth, supported by broader participation and more diversified 
channels of access. Beyond equities, the development of debt-linked instrument markets is 
a logical next step towards achieving balanced, diversified portfolios and meeting long-term 
financial goals.
A salient feature of the shift to equities is the increasing share of individuals in aggregate 
equity market ownership, achieved through both direct and indirect channels. The share 
of individual investors increased from ~11 per cent in FY14 to 14.3 per cent in FY19, and 
further to 18.8 per cent by September 2025. In absolute terms, individual equity holdings 
expanded to around ₹84 lakh crore by September 2025, from just 8 lakh crore in FY14. 
While the direct share of individuals in equity markets increased only gradually, from just 
under 8 per cent in FY14 to approximately 9.6 per cent by September 2025, the indirect 
share nearly tripled over the same period, reaching 9.2 per cent. Between April 2020 to 
September 2025, household equity wealth is estimated to have increased by about ₹53 lakh 
crore, underscoring the role of sustained participation in driving long-term wealth creation 
in equity markets.
The evolving equity orientation is also evident in the flow of household financial savings. 
Between FY12 and FY25, gross financial savings increased substantially, accompanied by 
a notable reallocation across instruments. The share of equity and mutual funds in annual
65	SEBI’s Investor Survey 2025, https://tinyurl.com/mrw33mrn.

Economic Survey 2025-26
118
118
household financial savings increased from ~2 per cent in FY12 to over 15.2 per cent in 
FY25. This shift has coincided with a steady rise in SIP contributions, with average monthly 
SIP flows increasing seven times from under ₹4,000 crore in FY17 to over Rs 28,000 crore 
in FY26 (April-November).
The growing prevalence of systematic investments reflects a shift towards long-term and 
sustained household engagement with savings being channelled in a disciplined manner 
across market cycles. In contrast, the share of deposits declined from over 58 per cent in 
FY12 to around 35 per cent in FY25, after having fallen to as low as 31.9 per cent in FY22. 
This pattern suggests portfolio diversification rather than displacement, with households 
adding equity exposure to their existing savings rather than substituting entirely away from 
traditional instruments.
From a stock perspective, the rebalancing is equally evident in household balance sheets. 
According to RBI data, the share of equity and investment funds in total household financial 
assets increased from 15.7 per cent in March 2019 to 23 per cent by March 2025. Assets 
managed through mutual funds rose steadily relative to the size of the economy, increasing 
from <10 per cent of GDP in the early 2010s to ~23 per cent by FY26 (as of November 2025), 
amounting to over ₹80 lakh crore.

The post-pandemic period marked a decisive inflexion in household engagement with 
equity markets. The unique investor base expanded sharply in the initial years following 
the pandemic, rising from around 3.1 crore in FY20 to over 11 crore by FY25. Although net 
additions to the investor base have moderated in the current fiscal, net inflows of domestic 
investors into equity markets have remained resilient. Over the past five years, cumulative 
inflows by domestic investors into the equity markets have been substantially higher than 
from foreign investors. This shift highlights the increasing ability of domestic savings to 
support equity markets, stabilise the market, and mitigate the volatility associated with 
external capital flows.
A well-diversified portfolio should include adequate exposure across a broad range of asset 
classes. In this context, participation in debt, specifically market-based debt instruments, has 
not kept pace with the significant reorientation of household savings towards equities. The 
household ownership share of deposits has decreased, while that of pension and insurance 
assets has remained almost unchanged over the period from FY19 to FY24.
Retail engagement with corporate bonds and debt-oriented investment products remains 
limited, resulting in debt securities comprising a small portion of household financial assets. 
This limited participation of households in market-based debt instruments is mirrored in 
the overall shallow depth of India’s corporate bond market. India’s corporate bond market 
remains underdeveloped, accounting for around 16-17 per cent of GDP, compared with the 
equity market capitalisation of over 130 per cent of GDP. This is substantially lower than in 
major peer economies, such as the United States and China, where corporate bond markets 
constitute approximately 40 per cent and 36 per cent of GDP, as of 2024, respectively.

Economic Survey 2025-26

Developing a deep debt capital market requires market participants—issuers, investors, 
arrangers, and rating agencies—to act as market-builders. Key imperatives include 
enhancing transparency, pricing risk honestly beyond the siloes of AAA-rated bonds, and 
ensuring financial innovation remains standardised. Mechanisms such as partial guarantees 
and blended finance can help mid-tier companies access bond markets, unlocking capital 
for this segment and driving India's future growth. Equally, a shift from passive buy-and-
hold strategies to active trading is essential for building secondary market liquidity. A 
well-functioning debt market would reduce capital costs, mobilise savings efficiently, and 
offer households reliable income-generating products. India's households have embraced 
equities; extending that confidence to debt markets is the next frontier for building truly 
resilient portfolios and a mature financial system.
3.74	 Responding to the steady expansion of India’s capital market, SEBI has undertaken 
various steps throughout the current financial year in order to strengthen the regulatory 
framework, facilitate ease of doing business and investing, enhance investor protection 
and empowerment, and foster market development. These measures have been 
discussed in detail in Box III.8.
Box III.8: SEBI’s recent initiatives: Advancing regulatory excellence, market 
growth, and investor protection
SEBI undertook a comprehensive suite of initiatives aimed at reinforcing regulatory 
integrity, streamlining market operations, and enhancing investor protection. Collectively, 
these measures underscore SEBI’s commitment to fostering a transparent, resilient, and 
inclusive capital market ecosystem in India, while strengthening market confidence through 
improved verification, disclosure, accessibility, and risk surveillance across key segments of 
the securities market.
Investor protection and empowerment
To provide a verified and secure payment channel for financial transactions in the 
securities market, SEBI has mandated a new UPI address structure for all SEBI-registered 
intermediaries that collect funds from investors, effective 1 October 2025. Complementing 
this, the ‘SEBI Check’ was introduced to enable verification and enhance the safety and 
accessibility of investor payments. To combat financial fraud and scams, SEBI launched 
a joint media campaign titled ‘SEBI vs SCAM’ in collaboration with Market Infrastructure 
Institutions in July 2025, focusing on identifying red flags, raising awareness about 
verification protocols,  trusted redressal mechanisms, and good digital practices. In parallel, 
a nationwide training initiative for block-level Panchayat representatives was launched in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) to promote financial literacy 
and investor education at the grassroots level. Furthermore, SEBI mandated that all digital 
platforms of regulated entities comply with the provisions of the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities Act, 2016, and corresponding rules, enabling the full and effective participation 
of persons with disabilities in the securities market.

Strengthening the bond market and expanding access 
SEBI introduced a new framework for ESG Debt Securities (other than green debt securities), 
outlining regulatory requirements for issuers of social, sustainability, and sustainability-
linked bonds. To improve awareness and traction in municipal debt, outreach programmes 
on Municipal Bonds and Municipal Finance were organised, providing a common platform 
for stakeholders to discuss issuer concerns, investor requirements, and the extant regulatory 
framework, while also recommending measures to deepen the market. In support of 
municipal bond development, credit rating agencies were advised to extend the EL-based 
rating scale for rating municipal bonds issued to finance infrastructure assets, in addition to 
the standardised rating scale. Additionally, to facilitate ease of doing business and improve 
transparency and data dissemination to investors and credit rating agencies for the issuance 
of securitised debt instruments (SDI), SEBI aligned the guidelines for the issue and listing 
of SDIs with the RBI guidelines on Securitisation of Standard Assets.
Strengthening the regulatory framework and improving operational efficiency 
To facilitate SEBI-registered stock brokers in undertaking securities market-related activities 
in GIFT-IFSC under a Separate Business Unit, the requirement of obtaining specific SEBI 
approval was removed. Listed entities were mandated to follow industry standards on 
the ‘minimum information’ to be provided to the audit committee and shareholders for 
the approval of related-party transactions, thereby strengthening governance and review 
processes. SEBI also streamlined requirements pertaining to the minimum contribution 
from sponsors and sponsor groups in the public issue of units for the conversion of a private 
listed Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvIT) into a public InvIT. Further, registered 
intermediaries were permitted to use the ‘e-KYC Setu System’ of the National Payments 
Corporation of India as an alternative to Aadhaar-based e-KYC authentication.
Fostering market development and improving product depth 
To provide investors with independent verification of the risk and return claims of 
investment advisers, research analysts, and algorithmic trading providers, SEBI introduced 
a Past Risk and Return Verification Agency for risk-return performance verification; its 
operationalisation is in process. In the derivatives space, electricity derivatives, starting 
with monthly futures trading at NSE, were launched on 18 July 2025. SEBI and the Central 
Electricity Regulatory Commission adopted a robust, consultative, and data-driven approach 
to contract design and risk management norms, ensuring these derivatives function as 
hedging instruments rather than vehicles for undue speculation.
Measures to strengthen equity derivatives markets 
To curb expiry-day volatility and promote uniformity, exchanges were directed to select 
either Tuesday or Thursday as the expiry day for equity derivatives. SEBI also introduced 
revisions to improve trading convenience and strengthen monitoring, including a new 
methodology for calculating open interest as future equivalent open interest at a portfolio 
level using delta adjustments, recalibrating the market-wide position limit for single stocks, 
defining new eligibility criteria for derivatives on non-benchmark indices, and recalibrating

entity-level position limits based on the revised market-wide position limit definition. In 
addition to end-of-day monitoring, exchanges were directed to monitor position limits for 
equity index derivative contracts on an intraday basis.
Debt market 
3.75	A well-developed corporate bond market is indispensable to India's financial 
system and its path toward becoming a Viksit Bharat by 2047. Such a market channels 
institutional and household savings into productive sectors, strengthens efficient price 
discovery through a robust yield curve and supports the development of critical risk 
management instruments such as credit derivatives and securitisation. For the financial 
sector specifically, a deep corporate bond market reduces systemic concentration risk 
and dependence on bank-dominated financing, thereby strengthening overall financial 
stability. By diversifying funding sources, the corporate bond market enables banks to 
redirect resources toward priority sectors, including rural credit, infrastructure, and 
MSMEs, advancing financial inclusion while lowering systemic fragility. Additionally, 
a vibrant bond market helps to lower borrowing costs through competitive pricing and 
improved liquidity. 
3.76	India's corporate bond market has demonstrated impressive growth, with 
outstanding issuances increasing from ₹17.5 trillion in FY15 to ₹53.6 trillion in FY25, 
growing with an annual rate of approximately 12 per cent. In FY25, the highest-ever 
fresh issuances were recorded, totalling ₹9.9 trillion. As of March 2025, the corporate 
bond market accounts for 15-16 per cent of the country’s GDP and corporate bond 
fundraising now complements bank credit, reflecting growing investor confidence and 
a gradual shift towards market-based financing. 
3.77	In FY26, the debt market accounted for over 63 per cent of total resource 
mobilisation from the primary market in April-December 2025. Government and 
SEBI initiatives to deepen the bond market contributed to the value of corporate bond 
issuances reaching ₹6.8 lakh crore by the end of December 2025. Private placements, 
accounting for more than 99 per cent of total resources mobilised through the bond 
market, remained the preferred mode. 
3.78	Despite the recent progress, a significant potential remains untapped in the 
country compared to global peers: South Korea's corporate bond market is 79 per 
cent of its GDP, in Malaysia, it is 54 per cent of its GDP, and in China, 38 per cent. 
Furthermore, India’s debt market is skewed towards highly rated borrowers (AAA or 
AA-rated), which accounts for 85-90 per cent of bond issuances. In contrast, the US 
presents a more liquid and mature corporate debt market catering to various segments. 
The US has less than five per cent of its bond issuances from AAA-rated categories, with 

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation
123
123
over 60 per cent of its issuances in the A- and BBB-rated categories. In India, with the 
dominance of private placements, public offerings remain limited, deterring access for 
small firms. The secondary market remains shallow, with India's annual bond turnover 
ratio in secondary markets at 0.3, lower than that of Indonesia (1.17) and China (1.16).66 
3.79	The major issuers in the corporate debt market include Public Sector Undertakings, 
Public Financial Institutions, and banks. As of 31 December 2025, the market comprised 
6,351 issuers with a total of 29,638 instruments outstanding. The principal investor 
base consists of banks, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, and NBFCs. 
Out of approximately 30,000 ISINs,67  only 400-500 ISINs are traded on a daily basis. 
New issuances are traded for a month or so, and then they are held until maturity, 
essentially becoming a type of investment. The daily average secondary market volume 
ranges from ₹7,000 crores to ₹10,000 crores. Only a small group of institutional 
investors participate in the primary markets, which limits the supply of bonds available 
for trading in the secondary market.
3.80	Institutional investors are shown to exhibit structural preferences influenced by 
return profiles, risk assessments, regulatory incentives, and prevailing market liquidity 
conditions. As a result, they tend to favour equities and government securities over 
corporate bonds. This trend may be contributing to the constraining of the corporate 
bond market's growth and development.68
3.81	As noted by the Niti Aayog Report, limitations also stem from regulatory overlaps 
between SEBI, RBI, and the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA); extensive disclosure 
requirements that deter lower-rated issuers; restricted investment mandates for 
institutional investors, limiting their allocation to high-grade securities; and an 
underdeveloped risk management infrastructure. Additionally, weak debt recovery 
mechanisms, high transaction costs, and tax asymmetries reduce investor appetite and 
limit the flow of long-term capital. 
3.82	The regulatory authorities have undertaken substantial reforms for the development 
of the bond market. SEBI introduced the Request for Quote platform, facilitating retail 
access, strengthening governance standards for credit rating agencies, and simplifying 
issuance norms. The RBI has enhanced settlement architecture through tri-party repos 
and credit default swap guidelines. The Government's promotion of InvIT and Real 
Estate Investment Trusts demonstrates a sustained commitment to long-term capital 
mobilisation.

3.83	However, coordinated and phased reforms are the need of the hour. These include 
streamlining inter-agency alignment through joint circulars that clarify responsibilities 
across the regulators, as well as establishing single-window contact systems for issuers. 
Strengthening investor confidence in corporate debt also requires enhancing the 
effectiveness of the insolvency framework so as to accelerate recovery timelines. Long-
term structural development should prioritise upgrading market infrastructure through 
unified trading platforms and enhanced market-making capabilities, while expanding 
the investor base through targeted incentives, including simplified tax structures for 
bonds and regulatory flexibility for pension funds and insurance companies to invest in 
mid-rated securities.
3.84	A vibrant corporate bond market can help lower the cost of capital for Indian 
firms through competitive pricing, improved liquidity, and efficient price discovery. As 
the market deepens, towards a potential ₹100-120 trillion by 2030,69  intermediation 
costs should decline, particularly for the mid-market segment, where much of India's 
manufacturing capacity and job creation will emerge. Realising this vision demands 
sustained, coordinated policy focus, technological innovation, and regulatory 
harmonisation.
3.85	 However, financial deepening alone may not be sufficient to durably lower India's 
cost of capital. Box III.9 explores the structural drivers of capital costs, highlighting that 
the path to cheaper capital extends not only through financial markets but also through 
productivity and export competitiveness - themes central to India's development 
trajectory.  
Box III.9: What explains the persistently high cost of capital? - an exploration
India’s relatively high cost of capital is widely recognised as a constraint on private 
investment and long-run growth. For instance, over the past three decades, between 1995 
and 2025, India’s weighted average long-term interest rates70 averaged 7.61 per cent, far 
above the average long-term rates seen in Canada (3.13), Italy (2.94) and Switzerland (1.04). 
Even so, India has maintained a favourable average long-term interest rate as compared to 
other emerging economies such as Indonesia (14.1), Mexico (11.05) and South Africa (9.08). 
Much of the public discussion attributes this to financial-sector frictions – relatively shallow 
corporate bond markets, limited institutional investor depth, sovereign risk premia, and

70	Weighted long term interest rates is measured as a weighted average of central bank policy rates and 10-year 
government bond yields, weighted by the share of bank and market-based credit in total credit to the private 
non-financial sector.

regulatory restrictions on capital flows. While these factors influence the distribution of 
financing costs across firms and sectors, they do not fully explain the persistence of high 
economy-wide capital costs.
A more structural explanation for the high cost of capital in an economy links the cost of capital 
to the economy’s savings position and external balance. In open-economy macroeconomics, 
investment must be financed either by domestic savings or by foreign savings; the latter is 
reflected in the current account deficit (CAD). Economies that run persistent CADs are, by 
construction, dependent on external capital inflows to support domestic investment and 
consumption. This dependence introduces a risk premium, which financial markets price 
into interest rates and equity returns.71 In this sense, the cost of capital in CAD economies 
is not merely a financial-market outcome; it is also a price on the macroeconomic risk 
associated with a structural savings shortfall.
To empirically capture the structural relationship between the current account balance 
(CAB) and long-term interest rates, a panel data estimation is performed for 15 countries 
over the period from 1995 to 2025. The countries studied comprise a heterogeneous mix 
of developing and developed economies, which displayed floating or managed floating 
exchange rate regimes for the majority of the period in question. These include Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, 
Philippines, Thailand, South Africa and Switzerland. 
The cost of capital is captured by a weighted average of Central bank policy rates and 10-
year government bond yields, weighted by the share of bank and market-based credit in 
total credit to the private non-financial sector.
The pooled mean-group estimator developed by Pesaran, Shin and Smith, 199972 is employed 
to understand the long-run impact of these drivers on the interest rate.73  The equation below 
captures the long-run relationship between interest rates and their drivers.  The drivers of capital 
cost in the long run are given by the current account balance (CAB as a percentage of GDP), 
government debt (as a share of GDP), the extent of financial deepening measured by credit 
to the private sector (as a percentage of GDP), and GDP growth. Further, short-run interest 
rates are used to capture synchronous, cross-country monetary policy shifts which influence 
the trajectory of long-term interest rates. Finally, a trend term is incorporated to absorb global 
structural factors that may uniquely influence long-term rates (such as demographic factors, 
shifts in inflation expectations and rising demand for long-duration assets).

The results, reported in Table III.1, suggest that a one percentage point improvement in a 
country's CAB leads to a 2.8 basis point reduction in interest rates in the long run, while a 
one percentage point increase in private credit to GDP results in a 1.1 basis point decrease 
in rates. Thus, for the sample studied, improvements to the CAB proved nearly twice as 
effective in lowering the cost of capital over time as compared to financial deepening.

Policy Implications for India
The capacity to generate domestic savings at scale ultimately depends on productivity, 
operating margins and retained earnings in the production system. Labour productivity 
shapes unit labour costs, which in turn influence competitiveness and profitability. 
Profitability, in turn, feeds into retained earnings and corporate savings, and together 
with household savings, these constitute the pool of loanable funds that financial markets 
allocate. Where productivity and margins are thin, retained earnings are weak, corporate 
savings are low, and the economy becomes more reliant on external capital, raising the 
equilibrium cost of capital.
Rigidities in labour regulation and firm-scale dynamics have historically constrained capital 
deepening, learning by doing, and the movement of firms up the productivity ladder. Firms 
have often responded by remaining sub-scale or informalised to preserve flexibility, but this 
comes at the cost of productivity growth and margin durability. Alternatively, firms have sought 
protection from import competition to preserve their margins, but often to the detriment of 
their downstream competitiveness. The profitability thus generated has not been reinvested in 
productivity and innovation to the same extent, thereby hindering external competitiveness. 
The consequence is not simply slower manufacturing expansion, but an entrenched weakness 
in generating external surpluses, reinforcing reliance on foreign savings at the margin.
Historical experience across late-industrialising economies suggests that durable declines 
in capital costs tended to follow, rather than precede, periods of productivity-led expansion 
in manufacturing, sustained export growth and the emergence of external surpluses. In such 
phases, aggregate demand is supported by exports, inflationary pressures are more 

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation

contained, expectations of exchange-rate depreciation are lower, and the risk premium 
embedded in capital costs declines. 
By contrast, growth patterns that rely disproportionately on domestic demand and credit-
enabled consumption, without commensurate productivity and export gains, may raise 
near-term activity but do not materially strengthen surplus formation. In a structurally 
savings-short setting, this configuration tends to sustain a weaker currency and rollover-
risk premium in domestic capital costs.
Financial-sector reforms remain important. Deeper bond markets, broader institutional 
participation, credible benchmarks and improved risk pricing can reduce intermediation 
costs and improve capital allocation. However, such reforms are most effective in 
environments where domestic savings are increasing and the external position is improving. 
Greater reliance on foreign capital can bridge temporary gaps but, when persistent, tends 
to elevate risk premia and narrow policy space—outcomes that are already reflected in the 
pricing of capital in CAD economies.
The strategic implication is that reducing India’s cost of capital requires attention not 
only to financial intermediation but also to the drivers of production, exports, and surplus 
generation. Policies that support firm-level scale and deregulation, improve logistics, 
infrastructure, and trade facilitation, deepen technological capabilities and R&D, and enable 
sustained participation in global value chains can strengthen productivity and margins in 
manufacturing. As firms retain more earnings, corporate savings rise. As exports expand and 
trade and current account surpluses emerge and stabilise, dependence on foreign savings 
diminishes, expectations of depreciation moderate, and the external-balance component of 
the risk premium embedded in capital costs falls over time.
The durable route to a lower cost of capital is therefore inseparable from a growth pattern 
anchored in higher productivity, enhanced manufacturing competitiveness, sustained 
export growth, and the gradual transition from structural savings deficit to structural 
savings strength.  Financial deepening can support and accelerate this transition, but it 
cannot substitute for it. Indeed, these are the recurring messages that run throughout this 
Economic Survey.
Foreign Portfolio Investment 
3.86	India’s Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) trends in FY26 exhibit volatility. During 
Q1 FY26, FPIs were net buyers of Indian equities and net sellers of debt instruments. In 
contrast, in Q2 FY26 and Q3 FY26, they transitioned from being net buyers of equities 
to net sellers, while being net buyers of debt instruments. As of 13 January 2026, FPIs 
are net sellers of Indian equities with outflows amounting to ₹16.5 thousand crore.

3.87	Overall, FPIs were net sellers of Indian securities from April to December 2025. 
The relative underperformance of Indian equities compared to other major markets, 
alongside trade and policy uncertainties, the depreciation of the Indian rupee, and a 
broad-based global risk-off sentiment amid elevated U.S. bond yields, weighed on FPI 
flows. These factors dampened sentiment towards Indian equities, particularly export-
oriented sectors such as IT and healthcare, resulting in continued FPI outflows in FY26 
(April-December).

3.88	In late May 2025, the spread between 10-year Indian and US government bond 
yields narrowed to 165 basis points amid a stronger US dollar and falling Indian yields, 
reducing the relative attractiveness of Indian debt. However, by the end of 2025, as 
Indian yields rose and the dollar weakened, the spread widened to 250 basis points, 
improving the appeal of Indian bonds. Supported by SEBI’s relaxation of FPI investment 
norms and ongoing India-US trade discussions, the outlook for FPI inflows into India’s 
debt market remains positive.
3.89	As of 31 December 2025, the asset base under custody of FPIs stood at ₹81.4 
lakh crore, marking a 10.4 per cent increase over March 31, 2025, driven largely by 
valuation gains in equities and steady accumulation in debt holdings.74  Within NSE-
listed equities, however, the share of FPI ownership declined to 16.9 per cent (for Q2 
FY26), in line with global risk aversion and sectoral reallocations.
Domestic Institutional Investors: Counterbalancing FPIs 
3.90	In the midst of volatile foreign capital flows, domestic institutional investors 
(DIIs), particularly mutual funds and insurance companies, have counterbalanced the 
volatility of foreign investment outflows and have provided much-needed support to

GIFT City 
3.93	The present era is characterised by intensified competition to attract global capital, 
with both developed as well as developing countries vying for productive capital to fuel 
their growth. While financial centres were an innovation of the era of globalisation, their 
relevance is exalted in the presence of intensified competition to attract global capital. 
In this context, the achievements and progress made by India’s maiden International 
Financial Service Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City (Gandhinagar) provides a glimpse into 
India’s advancements toward creating an enabling ecosystem for attracting and 
channelling global capital. 
3.94	 The International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA), established in 
April 2020 under the IFSCA Act 2019, serves as GIFT City's unified regulator with a 
mandate to develop and regulate financial products, services, and institutions within 
the IFSCs. By consolidating regulatory powers previously dispersed across RBI, SEBI, 
Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (IRDAI), and Pension Fund 
Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) for IFSC operations, IFSCA enables a 
cohesive regulatory approach aligned with international standards. 
3.95	Prior to GIFT City's establishment, many Indian companies raised funds or 
managed offshore investments through jurisdictions such as Singapore, Mauritius, and 
the Cayman Islands, largely due to more favourable tax and regulatory frameworks. 
The IFSC architecture aims to bring back financial services transactions currently 
conducted outside India by overseas financial institutions and overseas branches of 
Indian financial institutions to Indian shores, thereby attracting multinational banks, 
investment funds, and technology firms to generate high-value jobs, draw global capital, 
and reduce financial outflows to offshore centres. 
3.96	 GIFT City has shown a strong growth momentum, with over 1,034 domestic and 
international entities registered across various categories as of 30 November 2025.79 
Within a year, GIFT City has moved up nine places in the Global Financial Centres 
Index (GFCI), reaching a rank of 43 out of 120 financial centres. Within the fintech-
specific ranking, GIFT City improved by ten places, reflecting progress made through 
a dedicated regulatory framework for fintechs, academic partnerships and innovation 
centres. Table III.2 presents the major financial operations in GIFT City and their 
achievements to date.

similar campuses.
3.98	Two developments in 2025 underscore GIFT City's growing regional and 
operational significance. In June, Sri Lanka's DFCC Bank listed Sri Lankan Rupee 2.5 
billion in green bonds on the NSE International Exchange—the first listing by a foreign 
corporation on a GIFT IFSC exchange, signalling the centre's emergence as a regional 
capital-raising hub. The Foreign Currency Settlement System (FCSS), launched in 
October 2025, enables the local settlement of foreign-currency transactions between 
IFSC banking units without routing them through overseas correspondent banks. The 
FCSS operates on a real-time or near real-time basis, substantially reducing settlement 
times while enhancing transaction security and cost-effectiveness. This infrastructure 
positions GIFT City for future innovation in cross-border payments.

population is expected to increase from 10.1 per cent to 14.9 per cent. At the same time, 
the proportion of the working-age population (15-59) is projected to increase marginally 
from 64.2 per cent to 64.9 per cent during the same period.81  As today's workers approach 
retirement, it is essential that they be covered by a stable and secure pension scheme. In 
this context, the PFRDA has laid the groundwork for a vibrant pension system, offering a 
range of options for its users and covering a broad population bracket. 
3.100	 India's pension landscape features a multi-tiered system dominated by the 
market-linked National Pension System (NPS), the government-backed Unified 
Pension Scheme (UPS) launched in 2025, and other schemes like the Employees' 
Provident Fund (EPF) and Atal Pension Yojana (APY) for broader coverage.
3.101	 The NPS architecture caters to a wide range of demographics: central and state 
government employees, private sector workers, corporate entities, minors under the NPS 
Vatsalya and individuals from the unorganised sector. As of 31 December 2025, there 
were 211.7 lakh subscribers to NPS and managed assets worth ₹16.1 crore.82 Over the past 
decade (FY15 to FY25), NPS subscribers have grown at a CAGR of 9.5 per cent, and the 
assets under management (AUM) have rapidly increased at a CAGR of 37.3 per cent.

3.102	 The APY, which envisions a social security system for all citizens, is open to 
all Indian citizens who hold a savings bank account. Since its inception in 2016, APY 
subscriptions have grown at a robust CAGR of 43.7 per cent, and AUM have shown 
exemplary growth at a CAGR of 64.5 per cent.
3.103	 The government introduced the UPS vide notification dated 24 January 2025, 
as an option under the NPS for Central Government employees. It aims to blend the 
best features of previous systems by guaranteeing a minimum pension and allowing 
investment-based growth, providing stability and flexibility for retirees.
3.104	 NPS Vatsalya is a contribution-based saving-cum-pension scheme for minors, 
which aims not only to secure the future of its young subscribers but also emphasises 
the importance of nurturing a culture of savings from an early age.
3.105	 PFRDA has introduced several pensions and retirement schemes specifically 
targeting platform (gig) workers and the agricultural (agribusiness) sector, aiming 
to widen the social security net and ensure financial security among India's informal 
workforce. The NPS e-Shramik (Platform Service Partner) Model was launched on 29 
October 2025. This model is designed for platform workers and seeks to integrate them 
into mainstream retirement savings through the NPS.83
3.106	 PFRDA is partnering with Farmer-Producer Organisations (FPOs) and  MSMEs 
to bring pension coverage to more workers in the agriculture sector, including 
farmers, FPO members, and participants of self-help groups. The focus is on enrolling 
agriculture workers under the NPS and the APY, both of which provide flexible, long-
term retirement savings options, including a guaranteed pension under APY. 
3.107	 India’s pension system has expanded steadily, yet overall coverage remains 
modest relative to the size of the workforce.84 Additionally, persistent awareness gaps 
prevail, with low-income and rural households maintaining limited exposure to long-
term retirement products.85 Recent efforts, such as simplified onboarding, NPS Lite 
variants, APY outreach campaigns, and targeted products for minors, gig workers, and 
farmer groups, demonstrate the progress being made in closing these long-standing 
coverage gaps.

3.108	  The predominance of informality continues to be the central constraint on 
achieving broad-based pension inclusion. Moreover, households with irregular incomes 
face difficulty committing to locked-in, long-horizon savings, even when contributions 
are modest. Accessibility is improving with digital KYC, e-NPS, and integrations 
with payment platforms, but flexible contribution structures and intuitive product 
design remain essential for workers with volatile cash flows. The inclusion of pension 
systems through platforms and apps – now seen in the UK, Singapore, and Europe 
- demonstrates a viable route for increasing contribution compliance when pension 
deductions are embedded into existing digital work interfaces.86 
3.109	 Adequacy and sustainability are becoming key priorities for the pension system 
as it expands over time. Global benchmarks, such as the Mercer CFA Global Pension 
Index, consistently rank India lower in terms of adequacy and system maturity, 
reflecting relatively low replacement rates and modest pension assets (around 17 per 
cent of GDP) compared to OECD peers (at least 80 per cent).87 Pension assets in India 
make up around 15-20 per cent of GDP, significantly less than the 60-100 per cent 
range seen in more advanced pension markets. 
3.110	 An area for further progress is regulatory coherence. Studies highlight the need 
for better alignment between EPFO, PFRDA, and state-level pension bodies to reduce 
fragmentation, enhance portability, and streamline governance.88 Strengthening 
actuarial evaluation frameworks, diversifying long-term investment portfolios, and 
deepening data-sharing mechanisms across institutions will be essential as longevity 
increases and old-age dependency continues its structural rise.
3.111	 The way forward for India's pension ecosystem lies in a calibrated expansion 
of both contributory and non-contributory schemes. At the contributory end, 
simplifying enrolment through Aadhaar-based authentication, enabling frictionless 
micro-contributions via digital payments, and synchronising pension outreach with 
broader financial inclusion drives can help deepen penetration. Engagement with state 
governments, cooperatives, farmer networks, and gig-platform companies can ensure 
last-mile reach. 
3.112	 The introduction of UPS and NPS Vatsalya demonstrates adaptive policymaking 
that responds to evolving demographic and labour-market realities while maintaining

long-term fiscal prudence. Continued innovation in service delivery, data integration 
and consumer guidance will be crucial for the next phase. Global experiences of 
developed pension systems underscore the value of lifecycle planning tools, personalised 
dashboards, and automated advisory nudges, all of which can be integrated into India’s 
maturing digital public infrastructure.89 
3.113	 Expanding interoperability across NPS, APY and other schemes will support 
seamless portability as workers shift sectors or migrate. Strengthening actuarial 
capabilities, improving risk-modelling frameworks, and promoting long-duration 
investment channels can enhance both resilience and returns. With sustained 
institutional strengthening, India is well-positioned to develop a pension system that is 
inclusive, future-ready, and anchored in global best practices.
Performance of the Insurance Sector
3.114	 The Indian insurance sector is undergoing a significant transformation, driven 
by the vision of ‘Insurance for All by 2047’, where every citizen possesses appropriate 
life, health and property insurance cover. In alignment with this objective, the IRDAI 
has been implementing a series of regulatory reforms to foster growth and empower 
policyholders.
3.115	 This sector has continued to widen its reach, reinforcing its role as a key 
mechanism for risk transfer and a vital channel for long-term savings mobilisation 
across households, enterprises, and the wider economy. With AUM reaching ₹74.4 
lakh crore in FY25, the sector’s financial depth has strengthened. Total premium 
income rose to ₹11.9 lakh crore in FY25 from ₹8.3 lakh crore in FY21. The life insurance 
segment dominates the landscape, holding 91 per cent of the total AUM and contributing 
approximately 75 per cent of the premium income. Structural shifts are evident in the 
‘non-life’ insurance segment, where health insurance, accounting for 41 per cent of 
the gross domestic premium, has overtaken motor insurance as the leading business 
line. All 26 life insurers, 26 non-life insurers, seven health insurers and two specialised 
insurers are active and supported by a network of over 83 lakh distributors.
3.116	 The sector demonstrated resilience in managing rising claims and liquidity 
demands. Life insurers paid benefits totalling ₹6.3 lakh crore in FY25. A compositional 
shift was observed in payouts, with surrender and withdrawal benefits rising to levels 
comparable to maturity payments. In the ‘non-life’ sector, net incurred claims escalated 
by over 70 per cent since FY21 to ₹1.9 lakh crore in FY25, primarily driven by the Health 
and Motor segments. To sustain this operational growth and absorb underwriting

volatility, the equity share capital of the ‘non-life’ sector increased to over ₹43,000 
crore, exceeding the Life sector’s base of ₹39,700 crore. This continuous capital infusion 
has ensured that both segments maintain healthy solvency margins.
3.117	 Accessibility infrastructure has been bolstered through a strategic mix of physical 
presence of insurers and intermediary expansion. The total number of insurers’ offices 
stood at 22,076 as of March 2025. Complementing this physical reach, the distribution 
network–comprising agents, point of sales persons, and institutional partners–grew 
significantly from approximately 48 lakh in FY21 to nearly 83 lakh in FY25. This 
expansion is vital for facilitating delivery of insurance services various segments and 
specially in reaching the rural and socio-economically weaker sections of society. 
3.118	 The non-life insurance segment has recorded strong growth in recent years, 
broadly keeping pace with nominal GDP growth. This expansion has been driven by 
rising demand for health insurance, mandatory motor insurance requirements, and 
increasing asset ownership. Standalone health insurers have emerged as one of the 
fastest-growing segments, highlighting the growing need for healthcare financing 
solutions.

3.119	 Despite the progress in Life and Non-life segments, insurance penetration 
remains low, resulting in a significant protection gap. Rapid escalation in healthcare 
costs, rising climate-related risks, and an increase in cyber-risk incidents have emerged 
as key challenges. A large proportion of households and MSMEs continue to remain 
uninsured, with insurance adoption uneven across regions and income groups. Closing

this protection gap is critical to strengthening household financial security and reducing 
vulnerability to financial shocks. Achieving this will require the insurance sector to 
grow at a substantially faster pace than nominal GDP.
3.120	 The exemption in GST on life insurance and individual health insurance policies, 
introduced from September 2025, has provided substantial relief to policyholders and 
made insurance services more affordable in these two critical lines. Backed by such 
tailwinds, the growth is expected to pick up and add new insurance policyholders. 
3.121	 The enactment of ‘Sabka Bima, Sabki Suraksha Act, 2025’ will usher in the 
much-awaited reforms in the insurance sector. An increase in the FDI limit to 100 per 
cent, accompanied by other amendments, paves the way for ease of doing business, the 
entry of more players, and enables the much-needed expansion of the sector to address 
the protection gap for individuals and businesses. Increased penetration and a fast-
growing insurance sector also imply the availability of long-term investable funds that 
support infrastructure growth.  Box III.10 provides the key provisions of the Act. 
Box III.10 Sabka Bima Sabki Raskha (Amendment of Insurance Laws)
The Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Act, 2025 has amended 
various provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938, the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, 
and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999, with a view to enhance 
citizens protection, deepen insurance penetration, accelerate growth and development of 
the insurance sector and to enhance the ease of doing business. The Act was notified on 21 
December 2025. Important provisions are as below:
•	
Increased FDI limit: The amendment has raised the FDI limit in Indian insurance 
companies from 74 per cent to 100 per cent. This will help in attracting stable and 
sustainable investment, facilitate technology transfer, enhance insurance penetration 
and social protection 
•	
Promote Ease of Doing Business: To ensure uninterrupted service and support to 
policyholders and to promote ease of doing business, one-time registration of insurance 
intermediaries has been provided.  Further, the limit for seeking IRDAI approval for 
transfer of shares of paid-up equity capital is has been raised from the current 1 per 
cent to 5 per cent for insurance companies. The requirement of Net Owned Funds for 
foreign reinsurers has been reduced from ₹5,000 crores to ₹1,000 crores to facilitate the 
entry of more reinsurers, thereby helping to build greater reinsurance capacities in the 
country. 
•	
Creation of Insurance Awareness: The amendment provides for the creation of a 
Policyholders’ Education and Protection Fund, to increase citizens’ awareness towards 
risk protection and promote education for policyholders

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation
139
139
•	
Improved Policyholders’ Protection: For greater Policyholders’ protection, IRDAI 
has been granted the power of disgorgement of wrongful gains made by an insurer or 
intermediary. The maximum penalty limit for insurers who default in complying with or 
acting in contravention of the Insurance Act or the IRDAI Act has been increased from 
₹1 Crore to ₹10 Crore. Insurance intermediaries have also been included under this 
provision. This would act as a deterrent and encourage legal and regulatory compliance. 
•	
Alignment with Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023: The amendment 
creates a legal anchor for effective use of digital public infrastructure in the insurance 
sector to ensure that policyholders’ information is duly secured and protected.
Furthermore, the Indian Insurance Companies (Foreign Investment) Amendment Rules, 
2025, were also notified on 30 December 2025 to facilitate ease of doing business by 
rationalising the conditions for Indian insurance companies and insurance intermediaries.
3.122	 For creating a universal social security system for all Indians, especially the 
under-privileged, two social security schemes in the insurance sector are in place, viz, 
Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha 
Bima Yojana (PMSBY), on a pan-India basis since May 2015. The schemes are being 
offered by public sector insurers and other insurers that are offering the product on 
similar terms, with the necessary approvals and tie-ups with banks and post offices for 
this purpose. As of 7 January 2025, cumulative enrolment under PMSBY and PMJJBY 
is 56.15 crore and 26.32 crore, respectively. Further, 1.73 lakh and 10.24 lakh claims 
have been paid under PMSBY and PMJJBY, respectively.
Structural Challenges: High operating costs
3.123	 While the sector has continued to grow at a robust pace, operational cost dynamics 
have continued to change within the insurance industry. Escalating acquisition and 
administrative costs have resulted in increased operating expenses for insurers across 
both life and non-life insurance segments.
3.124	 Despite the push for digital transformation, customer acquisition continues 
to depend heavily on expensive intermediary networks. Consequently, instead of 
technology leading to cost rationalisation, costs have steadily increased, with a 
significant portion of premiums being consumed by distribution overheads.
3.125	 The most visible implication of the high-cost regime is the widening divergence 
between insurance coverage depth and breadth. While insurance density has risen 
steadily to USD 97 in FY25, reflecting higher spending by households already integrated 
into the financial system, insurance penetration has stagnated and declined to 3.7 per 
cent. This paradox indicates that while the sector is successful in ‘deepening’ revenue 

Economic Survey 2025-26

140
from existing customers, high distribution costs are preventing a ‘widening’ of the 
risk pool. The rigid cost structure means premium growth fails to keep pace with 
nominal GDP, eroding the sector’s relative economic size. Lowering overall costs and 
distribution outgoes is essential to improve affordability, enabling the industry to tap 
into the ‘missing middle’ and reverse the decline in penetration.
3.126	 The escalating cost of acquisition is not merely an operational friction; it acts 
as a structural constraint on the sector’s evolution, creating distortions that limit 
inclusion, erode consumer value, and threaten long-term stability. Rationalising this 
cost structure is the critical lever required to transition the industry from a ‘high-cost, 
low-penetration’ equilibrium to a sustainable growth path.
3.127	 The high-cost model poses a risk to the core financial strength of insurers. 
Private life insurers, despite robust topline growth, have seen their net profit stagnate, 
as margins are compressed by escalating acquisition expenses. Similarly, the non-
life sector faces high combined ratios, forcing a heavy reliance on investment income 
to subsidise operations, a strategy that exposes the sector’s bottom line to capital 
market volatility. Rationalising acquisition costs would allow insurers to price risk 
more accurately and increase value to customers, making products and prices more 
affordable.
3.128	 The insurance sector stands at a pivotal juncture. While it has matured into one 
of the economy's deepest institutional pools of long-term capital, it remains constrained 
by a ‘low-penetration, high-cost’ equilibrium driven by a high-cost distribution model 
that has inflated the cost of protection, structurally limiting the sector’s reach despite 
its robust solvency and balance sheet strength. The path forward necessitates decisive 
shifts. Insurers must prioritise the digitisation of distribution to rationalise acquisition 
costs and restore ‘value for money’ to the policyholder. If the industry can successfully 
dismantle these cost inefficiencies, it will not only resolve the penetration-density 
paradox but also transform from a constrained aggregator of savings into a truly 
inclusive and resilient pillar of the economy.
CONCLUSION 
3.129	 In an era characterised by heightened global uncertainty, geopolitical flux, 
and rapid technological transformation, the quality of financial sector regulation has 
emerged as a critical determinant of economic resilience and sustained growth. India's 
financial regulatory architecture demonstrates a clear recognition of this imperative, as 
evidenced by RBI’s landmark framework for the formulation of regulations issued in May 
2025. This framework institutionalises a transparent, consultative, and impact-driven 

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation
141
141
approach to regulation-making, one that incorporates periodic reviews, stakeholder 
engagement through the Advisory Group on Regulation, and a dedicated Regulatory 
Review Cell tasked with systematically examining each regulation at least once every 
five to seven years. Such measures signal a paradigm shift from reactive regulation to 
proactive, anticipatory governance that can respond dynamically to evolving market 
conditions and global best practices. SEBI has demonstrated a parallel commitment to 
regulatory modernisation and investor protection. 
3.130	 India’s regulatory bodies for insurance and pension - IRDAI and PFRDA - have 
similarly advanced reforms to deepen financial inclusion and extend protection to 
underserved segments. IRDAI has transitioned towards a principle-based framework 
that consolidates regulations, reduces compliance burdens, and provides insurers with 
greater flexibility to innovate. Meanwhile, the Sabka Bima Sabki Raskha (Amendment 
of Insurance Laws) represents its commitment to digitising the insurance ecosystem 
and democratising coverage. PFRDA, meanwhile, has focused on widening the social 
security net to encompass India's vast informal workforce - the NPS e-Shramik model, 
launched in October 2025, integrates platform and gig workers into mainstream 
retirement savings, while partnerships with FPOs and MSMEs extend pension coverage 
to agricultural workers and self-help group participants through the NPS and APY.
3.131	 The systemic rise in regulatory quality has received international validation 
through the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted jointly by the IMF 
and World Bank in 2025.90,91  Both reports noted an increasingly resilient, diversified, 
and inclusive financial system, with total financial sector assets at nearly 187 per cent 
of GDP in CY 2024 and capital markets expanding from 144 per cent of GDP in CY 
2017 to 175 per cent in CY 2024. The assessments found that banks and NBFCs possess 
adequate capital buffers even under severe stress scenarios. 
3.132	 In today’s era, India’s financial sector regulators must walk the tightrope to 
balance growth with stability. They must strike a balance between openness to global 
capital flows and the need to insulate the domestic economy from volatile external 
shocks. Moreover, given India's heterogeneous financial landscape, where sophisticated 
metropolitan markets coexist alongside underserved rural segments, regulators must 
exercise differentiated supervision: a shorter leash for emerging or fragile segments 
prone to excessive risk-taking and greater latitude for mature markets. In this context, 
so far, India's financial sector regulators have managed the balancing act deftly. Box 
III.11 discusses how the regulatory system must evolve towards proportionality, 
contestability, and risk-appropriate supervision without compromising stability.

Box III.11: Finance for growth: paving the way for Viksit Bharat
India’s aspiration to become a Viksit Bharat by mid-century demands a fundamental 
rethinking of finance, not merely as funding, but as the architecture of economic 
transformation. Finance, in its broader institutional and behavioural sense, governs how 
effectively capital is mobilised, allocated, and sustained across the economy. It is the central 
enabler. When finance builds trust, fosters competition, and enables innovation, it becomes 
the catalyst of development.
A nation does not develop by spending more but by expanding its productive base—enabling 
firms to invest and scale, households to earn and save securely, and markets to channel 
capital efficiently. This requires an enabling environment: rational taxation that supports 
enterprise, regulators that foster competition, financial markets that deepen and diversify, 
and administrative systems that operate transparently and promptly. Finance for Viksit 
Bharat is therefore about shaping conditions that generate and deploy resources efficiently.
Fostering certainty and predictability
This requires tax systems that are simpler and service-oriented, dispute resolution that 
is time-bound and fair, and the decriminalisation of technical offences. Regulators must 
promote competition and innovation while safeguarding stability. Credit and capital 
supply must move beyond bank dominance through deeper markets and modern financial 
infrastructure. Administrative processes should be centred on timeliness, proportionality, 
and citizen service.
Recasting financial regulation
Finance influences growth most visibly through regulation. Historically, India has placed 
a premium on banking system stability. As a result, long-term financing channels. Banks 
remain dominant, despite not being adequately equipped to finance infrastructure, energy 
transition, and large manufacturing projects with long horizons. India’s development 
aspirations require a diversified ecosystem where well-managed banks compete alongside 
NBFCs, fintechs, and market-based lenders. Diversification distributes risk and builds 
resilience, lessening vulnerability to shocks.
Diversified financial ecosystem calls for regulatory coordination, as, currently, India’s 
financial system is supervised by domain-specific regulators. Financial innovation 
increasingly blurs these boundaries. Banks distribute insurance and mutual funds; NBFCs 
perform functions similar to those of banks; fintechs intermediate credit and payments. To 
avoid regulatory arbitrage, inconsistency, and enforcement blind spots, regulation should 
shift from entity-based to activity-based frameworks, focusing on the risk and function of 
transactions rather than institutional labels. When entities engage in similar activities, they 
should face proportionate regulatory oversight based on their risk exposure. This promotes 
equality of treatment, competition, and innovation while ensuring systemic stability. Finally, 
enhanced inter-agency coordination is crucial for effective oversight of increasingly complex 
and interconnected financial entities.

Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation
143
143
India’s regulatory framework hitherto has rightly emphasised stability and systemic safety. 
The goal now must be to proportionality-calibrate regulation to risk and contestability, 
ensuring fair competition across entities and activities. The shift towards proportional, 
consultative, and accountable regulation is exemplified in the proposed Securities Markets 
Code, 2025 (Box III.6). 
Deepening long-term finance
To finance sustained growth, India must strengthen long-term capital markets. Corporate 
bond markets remain shallow and illiquid, dominated by top-rated issuers. Securitisation 
is limited, municipal bonds are underdeveloped, and pension and insurance funds remain 
conservative investors due to regulatory and cultural inertia. A coordinated agenda could 
address these barriers by:
•	
Rationalising tax treatment of debt instruments.
•	
Creating credit enhancement facilities for lower-rated issuers.
•	
Standardising securitisation structures and disclosures.
•	
Building municipal financial capacity and pooled bond mechanisms.
•	
Revising investment guidelines for long-term funds.
•	
Strengthening financial market infrastructure and insolvency systems.
Such reforms would supply the scale and maturity needed for infrastructure and climate 
financing while lowering the economy’s cost of capital.
Building a balanced financial ecosystem
The reforms taken together aim to shape a financial system that is stable yet competitive, 
diversified yet resilient, and innovation-friendly yet safe. Banks will remain central, but 
they must be seen as one part of a richer ecosystem that includes non-bank intermediaries 
and markets. Such a system reduces capital costs, expands financing options, facilitates 
structural transformation, and enhances the economy’s adaptive capacity.
