FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS: 
ANCHORING STABILITY 
THROUGH CREDIBLE 
CONSOLIDATION
At a time when public debt remains elevated globally, and fiscal space is under 
strain across countries, the Central Government’s fiscal trajectory stands out for 
combining consolidation with sustained public investment. The government’s 
calibrated fiscal strategy, anchored in credible deficit reduction, resilient 
revenue mobilisation, and a decisive reorientation of spending toward capital 
formation, has strengthened macroeconomic stability and supported growth 
in the post-pandemic period. Importantly, this fiscal resilience reflects prudent 
fiscal policy choices and careful fiscal management.
The Centre’s revenue receipts strengthened significantly, rising from an average 
of about 8.5 per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period (FY16-FY20) to around 
9.1 per cent in the post-pandemic years (FY22-FY25). This improvement was 
driven primarily by buoyant direct tax collections, supported by tax reforms, 
technology-enabled compliance, deeper formalisation, and improved corporate 
profitability. Among indirect taxes, GST collections have recorded multiple 
all-time highs in absolute terms during FY26, with growth broadly aligned to 
nominal GDP. The recent GST rate rationalisation reforms are expected to support 
demand by lowering tax incidence and improving price competitiveness, with 
volume and compliance effects helping to maintain revenue resilience. High-
frequency indicators, such as e-way bill generation, PMI readings, automobile 
sales, UPI transactions, and tractor sales, point to strengthening economic 
momentum in the recent months following these reforms.
On the expenditure side, consolidation has been achieved alongside an 
improvement in expenditure quality. Revenue expenditure moderated from 13.6 
per cent of GDP in FY22 to 10.9 per cent in FY25, creating space for productive 
capital outlays. Capital expenditure was scaled up from an average of 1.7 per 
cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period to approximately 3 per cent in the years 
following the pandemic, with effective capital expenditure reaching 4 per cent of 
GDP in FY25. This rebalancing was supported by subsidy rationalisation reduced 
leakages from Direct Benefit Transfers, and other public financial management 
reforms, such as Just-in-Time fund releases. As a result, fiscal indicators remain 
on track in FY26, indicating adherence to the budgeted consolidation path. 
The Central Government, through its Special Assistance to States for Capital

Expenditure/Investment (SASCI), has successfully incentivised the States to 
maintain capital expenditure at around 2.4 per cent of GDP in FY25. Further, 
the emerging fiscal trade-offs at the State level, particularly the rapid expansion 
of unconditional cash transfers, have been highlighted. While these provide 
immediate income support, their growing scale risks increasing expenditure 
rigidity and crowding out resources for capital investments, including human- 
capital.
Finally, the chapter demonstrates that, unlike many peer economies where 
post-pandemic debt unwinding has been limited, India has reduced its general 
government debt-to-GDP ratio by approximately 7.1 percentage points since 
2020, while sustaining high public investment. Going forward, the Central 
Government’s credible medium-term goal to converge towards a debt-to-GDP 
ratio of 50 ± 1 per cent provides the policy anchor for sustaining this consolidation 
at the general government level as well.
The chapter also offers certain reform suggestions for reducing cross-subsidies, 
stabilising the pipeline for equity monetisation by revising the definition of 
government companies, advancing the trust and nudge theory in e-way billing, 
and reaping efficiencies in spending. 
INTRODUCTION
2.1	 A key development for the Indian economy in 2025 was the recognition of its fiscal 
resilience by global rating agencies, reflected in three sovereign credit rating upgrades 
by Morningstar DBRS, S&P Global Ratings, and Rating and Investment Information, 
Inc. (R&I). These upgrades were attributed to India’s prudent fiscal management 
supported by continued deficit reduction, improved revenue buoyancy, and a clear shift 
in public spending toward growth-enhancing capital investment. Rating agencies also 
highlighted improved fiscal transparency and a credible medium-term consolidation 
path as factors that strengthen debt dynamics and reinforce confidence in India’s 
macroeconomic and fiscal framework.
2.2	 It is noteworthy that this fiscal resilience has been the outcome of deliberate 
and sustained policy effort rather than a natural and easy progression. At a time of 
elevated expenditure pressures and uncertainty around revenue streams, articulating a 
medium-term consolidation path and adhering to it required strong policy commitment. 
This chapter examines the fiscal policy choices made over the recent years that have 
strengthened the fiscal capacity of the Central Government while also encouraging 
healthier fiscal practices among the States. It begins with an assessment of the fiscal 
performance of the Centre and the States, followed by an analysis of government debt 
and the consolidated general government position, and concludes with an assessment 
of the fiscal outlook.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES
Fiscal policy as a key anchor of macroeconomic stability and confidence
2.3	 A predictable and credible fiscal trajectory by the Centre over the past years has 
anchored overall macroeconomic stability by balancing growth imperatives with fiscal 
sustainability. The Central government’s fiscal consolidation experience underscores 
the value of clearly defined fiscal targets alongside retained flexibility, thereby allowing 
fiscal policy to support rather than constrain growth during periods of uncertainty. In 
this context, the Union Budget for FY22 articulated a medium-term glide path, targeting 
a fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26, instead of binding annual targets, to 
ensure that growth-enhancing expenditure, particularly capex, was not compromised.
2.4	 Accordingly, the fiscal deficit declined from 9.2 per cent of GDP in FY21 to 4.8 
per cent of GDP in FY25 [Provisional Accounts, (PA)] and is budgeted at 4.4 per cent 
of GDP in FY26 (Chart II.1). Over the same period, the revenue deficit as a proportion 
of GDP has narrowed steadily, reaching its lowest level since FY09, thereby leaving 
a greater allocation for capex (Chart II.2) and reflecting a sustained improvement in 
the quality of expenditure. The decline in the primary deficit-to-GDP ratio1 during this 
period (Chart II.1), further indicates that fresh borrowings are now increasingly being 
used to service past interest obligations rather than to finance current spending. 
1 Primary Deficit (PD) = Fiscal Deficit (FD) − Interest Payments; A zero primary deficit means the government’s 
current revenues are sufficient to meet its non-interest expenditure; borrowing is only to service past debt. 
2  Fiscal Deficit = Total Expenditure − Total Non-Debt Receipts 
= (Revenue Expenditure + Capital Expenditure) − (Revenue Receipts + Non-Debt Capital Receipts) 
= (Revenue Expenditure − Revenue Receipts) + Capital Expenditure − Non-Debt Capital Receipts 
= Revenue Deficit + Capital Expenditure − Non-Debt Capital Receipts.

Sustained revenue buoyancy supports consolidation
2.5	 In an environment of heightened global volatility, government revenues have 
strengthened fiscal capacity, allowing expenditure needs to be met while following a 
consolidation path. An assessment of the Central Government’s receipts, comprising 
revenue receipts (net tax to Centre and non-tax revenues) and non-debt capital receipts, 
provides insight into the sources of this resilience.
2.6	 Revenue receipts increased from an average of about 8.5 per cent of GDP during the 
pre-pandemic period (FY16-FY20) to around 9.1 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic 
period (FY22-FY25 PA).3 This improvement was driven primarily by higher gross tax 
revenue, which rose from an average of 10.8 per cent of GDP to about 11.5 per cent of 
GDP over the same period. The buoyancy of revenues reflects both the strong growth 
momentum of the domestic economy and the cumulative impact of tax policy and tax 
administration reforms implemented by the Government. Within the overall stable tax 
revenues, the performance of individual tax components reveals notable shifts in the 
composition and sources of revenue growth.
Broadening of the Direct Tax Base
2.7	 The share of direct taxes in total taxes4 has increased in the past years, from 51.9 per 
cent in the pre-pandemic period to 55.5 per cent in the post-pandemic years, reaching 
58.8 per cent in FY25(PA). Table II.1 shows the trends in the components of direct taxes. 
Among these, the non-corporate tax collections5 have recorded a strong performance, 
with collections increasing from an average of about 2.4 per cent of GDP in the pre-
pandemic period to around 3.3 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic period. Even 
within the post-pandemic years, these collections rose from 3 per cent of GDP in FY22 
to about 3.7 per cent of GDP in FY25(PA). This momentum is also reflected in the strong 
average buoyancy6 of 1.8 observed in non-corporate taxes during FY23 to FY25(PA)7 , 
implying that collections grew faster than nominal GDP.
3	 Throughout the chapter FY16-FY20 is taken as pre-pandemic period, and FY22-FY25 is taken as the post-
pandemic period.
4	 Share of major direct taxes (i.e., Corporate tax + Taxes on income other than Corporate tax) in the total of major 
direct and indirect taxes (i.e, Corporate tax+ Taxes on income other than Corporate tax + Customs+ Excise+ GST 
+ Service tax).
5 Taxes on income other than Corporation tax, as reported in the Budget are being termed as Non-corporate tax 
in the chapter. This includes personal income tax collections, various cesses and surcharges, as well as securities 
transaction tax (STT).
6	 Tax buoyancy measures how responsive tax revenues are to changes in overall economic activity, typically GDP. It 
is measured as follows: Tax Buoyancy = per cent change in tax revenue (non-adjusted for policy or rate changes) 
÷ per cent change in GDP. Buoyancy value >1 implies that Tax revenue grows faster than GDP.
7	 Since the data in post post-pandemic period is taken for FY22-FY25, the growth rates/buoyancies during the 
period are reported for FY23-FY25 (Growth in FY22 was distorted due to a low base in FY21).

2.8	 This improvement has been supported by a steady expansion of the tax base. The 
number of income tax returns filed increased in the post-pandemic period, from 6.9 
crore in FY22 to 9.2 crore in FY258, reflecting gains from improved compliance, wider 
use of technology in tax administration, and a growing number of individuals entering 
the tax net as their incomes rise. Nudge-based interventions have emerged as a powerful 
tool for improving tax compliance and enhancing the efficiency of tax administration in 
India (See Box II.1).
Anchored in behavioural economics, the NUDGE (Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and 
Enable) approach adopted by the Income Tax Department, focuses on influencing taxpayer 
behaviour through timely information, gentle prompts, and data-driven insights rather 
than coercive enforcement. At its core, the NUDGE framework leverages large-scale data 
analytics to identify potential non-compliance, guide taxpayers with relevant information, 
and empower them to voluntarily correct or update their filings, without resorting to audits 
or litigation.  
For instance, the Foreign Asset Campaign prompted nearly 25,000 taxpayers to revise 
their returns, with over 61 per cent responding positively to nudges. This resulted in the 
declaration of foreign assets worth over ₹29,000 crore and foreign income exceeding 
₹1,000 crore, a significant portion of which was through belated returns. Similarly, nudges 
related to deductions under Section 80GGC led to a large-scale correction of claims, with 
over 91,000 taxpayers filing updated returns, a reduction of excessive deductions by nearly 
₹2,050 crore, and additional tax payments of over ₹680 crore. Similarly, targeted nudges 
led to a reduction in incorrect House Rent Allowance (HRA) claims, resulting in additional 
tax collections of over ₹119 crore.

Data-driven nudges also improved third-party reporting and accuracy in TDS filings. More 
than 8,500 deductors revised their TDS returns, adding over 1.08 crore deductees and 
bringing additional TDS of nearly ₹4,825 crore into the system. The tool also helped to 
identify non-genuine agricultural income of ₹2,038.02 crore from 310 entities and capital 
gains of ₹33,057.28 crore earned through Offer for Sale (OFS) by promoters during Initial 
Public Offers. 
Overall, the NUDGE initiative has improved tax collection efficiency by shifting the focus 
from post-facto enforcement to preventive, technology-enabled compliance. It has reduced 
friction, litigation, and compliance costs for both taxpayers and the administration, while 
increasing revenue through voluntary means. By combining data, behavioural insights, 
and transparent communication, nudge-based tax administration represents a modern, 
efficient, and citizen-centric approach to revenue mobilisation.
2.9	 Corporate tax collections also recorded an average buoyancy close to unity during FY23-
FY25, broadly in line with nominal GDP growth. This reflects the resilience and recovery of the 
private corporate sector in the post-pandemic period. According to the Reserve Bank of India, 
aggregate corporate profits of listed companies have increased from around ₹2.5 trillion in 
FY21 to ₹7.1 trillion in FY25, resulting in a more than 100 per cent increase in corporate tax 
collections over this period.9
2.10	During the current fiscal year, the major direct taxes10 reached nearly 53 per cent 
of the Budget estimates as of November 2025, as against 56.6 per cent during the 
corresponding period of the previous year. Personal income tax collections grew by 
6.8 per cent YoY, and corporation tax collections increased by 7.8 per cent YoY during 
the period, reflecting the various tax concessions granted during this time. The Union 
Budget 2025-26 ushered in significant income-tax relief for the middle class, with 
no personal income tax payable for income11 upto ₹12 lakh (₹12.75 lakh for salaried 
taxpayers) alongside changes in slabs and rates as well as in TDS rules. The new Income 
Tax Act, 2025, which focuses on simplification, structural clarity, and continuity of tax 
policy, was enacted on August 21, 2025, and is slated to take effect from the tax year 
2026-27.
Excise and Customs Duties: Supporting growth through rate 
rationalisation
2.11	 Among major indirect taxes, excise duty collections moderated in the post-
pandemic period, declining from about 1.7 per cent of GDP in FY22 to around 0.9 per 
cent of GDP in FY25. This moderation was driven by reductions in excise duty rates on 
petroleum products in 2021 and 2022, along with relatively moderate growth in petrol 
and diesel consumption during FY24 and FY25.

2.12	At the same time, the moderate buoyancy of 0.4 in customs duty collections 
during the post-pandemic period reflects calibrated reductions in basic customs duties 
on raw materials and essential goods aimed at supporting domestic manufacturing and 
containing input costs. This trend was further reinforced by softer global commodity 
prices, including crude oil, as taxes levied on an ad valorem basis move in line with 
prices.
2.13	During the current fiscal year, both excise duty and custom duty collections have 
reached about 60 per cent of their respective Budget estimates as of the end of November 
2025, as against 55 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, during the corresponding 
period of the previous year. While the excise duty collections witnessed a growth of 9.3 
per cent, the customs collections have reduced by 7.3 per cent on a YoY basis.
Goods and Services Tax: Revenue stability amid ongoing reform
2.14	The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has played a stabilising role by strengthening 
Government revenues, deepening formalisation, and reinforcing the Government’s 
reform intent. Gross GST revenue during April-December 2025 stood at ₹17.4 lakh 
crore, recording a YoY growth of 6.7 per cent (Chart II.3). The GST revenue growth has 
broadly aligned with the prevailing nominal GDP growth conditions, thus influenced 
in part by lower inflation (Chart II.4a). As a result, while growth rates appear lower in 
percentage terms, collections in absolute terms have recorded multiple all-time highs 
during the current fiscal year.

2.15	The underlying strength of GST revenues is reflected in the steady expansion of 
the tax base, with registered taxpayers increasing from about 60 lakh in 2017 to over 
1.5 crore at present, indicating deeper formalisation of economic activity. In parallel, 
high-frequency indicators suggest robust transaction volumes, with cumulative e-way 
bill volumes during April-December 2025 growing by 21 per cent YoY (Chart II.4b).
2.16	Looking ahead, the recent rationalisation of GST rates is expected to support 
demand by lowering tax incidence and improving price competitiveness. Since the 
lower rates are expected to stimulate higher consumption volumes and strengthen 
compliance, volume effects could offset the impact of rate reductions on revenues. 
Accordingly, GST collections are expected to remain resilient in the coming quarters. 
The expected channels of impact of these measures are discussed in Box II.2.
The 56th meeting of the GST Council has brought in a two-rate structure with a Standard 
Rate of 18 per cent, a Merit Rate of 5 per cent and a special de-merit rate or sin-good rate 
of 40 per cent for a select few goods and services (but inclusive of earlier compensation 
cess rate, and hence with no increase in overall tax burden). The rationalisation of GST 
with effect from 22.09.2025 came as the third leg of the tripod of tax reforms, following the 
corporate tax reductions of 2019 and personal income tax reforms w.e.f. April 2025.

Insurance Policies
•

The reduction in the tax burden on essential goods, services, and emerging sectors is expected 
to lower the cost of living, improve affordability, and stimulate household consumption 
demand. At the same time, the move towards a simplified two-rate structure is expected 
to reduce transaction costs, ease compliance, and encourage small businesses to enter the 
formal sector, thereby supporting greater formalisation and widening of the tax base.
Through targeted rate reductions across key sectors, the reform is expected to enhance 
trade competitiveness and support domestic manufacturing. Lowering the GST on cement 
and construction materials is expected to reduce project costs and support real estate 
and infrastructure activities. The reduction in GST on small cars, two-wheelers, and auto 
parts is expected to boost demand and strengthen India’s automotive manufacturing base. 
Reducing GST to zero per cent on select life-saving drugs and 5 per cent on medical devices 
is likely to improve healthcare access while encouraging domestic production. Similarly, 
the shift to a 5 per cent GST rate on toys, handicrafts, and man-made fibres is expected 
to support labour-intensive MSMEs and expand export potential, collectively reinforcing 
growth and investment momentum under the reformed GST regime. Beyond growth and 
formalisation, reduction of GST on solar, wind and related renewable devises from 12 per 
cent to 5 per cent, in addition to lowering GST on biodegradable bags from 18 per cent to 
5 per cent is a major push towards advancing India’s climate goals by making renewable 
energy, waste management, biodegradable products, and green mobility more affordable 
and within reach. 
Aligned with the Viksit Bharat 2047 vision, GST 2.0 also strengthens India’s position as a 
global manufacturing and investment destination. The inverted duty structure (IDS) under

GST, where tax rates on inputs exceed those on outputs, can be structurally eliminated by 
taxing inputs and intermediate goods at lower rates and placing items of final consumption 
at relatively higher rates. Keeping in view the need for a calibrated reform approach, next-
generation GST reforms have already corrected inverted duty in key labour-intensive and 
agri-input sectors such as textiles and fertilisers, thereby reducing cost and working capital 
pressures in these sectors. Further, items rationalised from 12 per cent to 5 per cent or 
to the nil rate largely pertain to goods of mass and daily consumption. Any residual IDS 
issues arising from such rationalisation are being addressed through faster, fully automated 
refunds of unutilised Input Tax Credit (ITC), thereby alleviating working capital stress. 
Going forward, policy options such as permitting IDS refunds on capital goods and input 
services may be examined to preserve tax neutrality without significant revenue erosion.
Recent trends in high-frequency indicators, including higher e-way bill generation, improved 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) readings for manufacturing and services, record festive-
season automobile sales, robust UPI transactions, and increased tractor sales, indicate a 
strengthening economic momentum during September-December 2025, following the 
implementation of GST reforms.
2.17	 With the introduction of GST in 2017, the abolition of physical check-posts across 
States marked a major structural reform, significantly improving the free movement 
of goods and reducing transit delays. The e-Way Bill system emerged as an effective 
digital substitute, enabling online tracking of goods movement while supporting tax 
administration objectives without reintroducing physical barriers at the State borders. 
Technology has evolved over time, as have the needs of modern business and logistics. 
Mobile-based checks of e-Way Bills at interior points may, at times, lead to avoidable 
disruptions in logistics and compliance friction for bona fide trade.
2.18	The next wave of GST reforms could, therefore, focus on reimagining the e-Way 
Bill system as a facilitator of smooth logistics rather than only as a tool for enforcement 
and control, in line with the changing needs of businesses and supply chains. As in 
the case of NUDGE (Box II.1), policy design could increasingly rely on trust-based 
and technology-driven compliance models, such as a “trusted dealer” framework, 
under which taxpayers with a strong compliance record face minimal physical checks 
and enjoy greater certainty in the movement of goods. At the same time, wider use 
of e-seals and electronic locking systems, integrated with e-Way Bills and vehicle-
tracking technologies, can ensure secure, end-to-end tracking of consignments without 
routine stoppages on the road. State Governments, which play a key role in field-level 
enforcement, would be central to this transition by shifting towards risk-based, system-
generated alerts and limiting discretionary checks. Together, these reforms would 
amount to a significant deregulation of the logistics ecosystem, reducing costs and delays 
for trade while maintaining effective, non-intrusive oversight for tax administration.

Non-tax revenues buoyed by rising dividends and profits
2.19	The non-tax revenues of the Centre, as a percentage of GDP, have broadly remained 
stable at around 1.4 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic period, in line with the pre-
pandemic average, thereby providing steady support to the Centre’s revenue receipts. 
This stability has been underpinned largely by a surge in dividends and profits, which grew 
by over 70 per cent annually during the last two years (Table II.2). The increase reflects 
higher surplus transfers from the RBI, along with improved financial performance of 
public sector banks and financial institutions. During FY26, RBI approved a surplus 
transfer of ₹2.68 lakh crore to the Central Government for the accounting year FY25, 
which is about 27 per cent higher than the dividend of ₹2.19 lakh crore paid in the 
previous year. As a result, during April to November 2025, non-tax revenues registered 
a growth of 20.9 per cent, reaching 88.6 per cent of the Budget Estimates for the year. 
Among “other” components of non-tax revenue, economic services accounted for a 
significant share, with major contributions from communication, roads and bridges.
economic and general services etc.
2.20	The improved performance of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) has 
also contributed to the growth in the Centre’s non-tax revenues. Between FY20 and 
FY25, the gross turnover per CPSE increased by approximately 32 per cent, while net 
profits and dividends per CPSE went up by 174 per cent and 69 per cent respectively 
(Table II.3), reflecting operational efficiency and effective capital management of 
PSUs. This has also helped to protect the interests of minority stakeholders in CPSEs.

Non-debt capital receipts
2.21	Receipts from asset and equity monetisation are an important component of the 
Government’s non-debt capital receipts. During FY26 (up to 31 December 2025), the 
disinvestment activity remained focused on market-based transactions aligned with 
valuation discipline and minimum public shareholding norms. Three OFS transactions 
were undertaken – in Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, Bank of Maharashtra and 
Indian Overseas Bank. These OFS transactions together mobilised around ₹7,717.02 
crore. In addition, remittances from SUUTI12 totalled approximately ₹1,051 crore 
during the year. InvIT-based monetisation yielded ₹18,837 crore. 
2.22	Strategic disinvestment has progressed in a calibrated manner over recent years. 
Since 2016, in-principle approval has been accorded for strategic disinvestment for 36 
CPSEs, of which 13 transactions have been completed, with the remainder at various 
stages of implementation. During FY26, approvals were also accorded for stake dilution 
or exit from select joint ventures, including NTPC’s divestment from Utility Powertech 
Limited. These actions were complemented by governance reforms that empowered 
CPSE Boards to undertake the closure, merger, or disinvestment of subsidiaries. 
2.23	Going forward, receipts from equity monetisation can be strengthened by 
selectively reducing Government equity in certain CPSEs beyond the minimum public 
shareholding norms13, guided by market conditions and enterprise-specific factors. 
Currently, in about 30 per cent of listed CPSEs, Government shareholding is already 
below 60 per cent, limiting further disinvestment through OFS, as it is stipulated in 
the Companies Act that a ‘government company’ must have at least 51 per cent of its 
stake held by the central or state government. Since effective control requires only 
about a 26 per cent stake, the Government could consider amending the definition of 
“Government Company” under the Companies Act, limited to listed entities, to allow 
them to remain as government companies with a minimum of 26 per cent ownership, 
thereby retaining special resolution rights, while enabling the government to monetise 
its stake. Alternatively, if the objective is eventual privatisation, the Government could 
continue phased OFS below 51 per cent and even towards full exit, without changing 
the legal definition of “government company”. This would enable CPSEs to function 
post-disinvestment as professionally managed entities with dispersed ownership, 
clear governance standards, and transparent succession frameworks. A portion of

Trends in expenditure
Continued rationalisation in revenue expenditure
2.24	As fiscal deficits consolidated in the aftermath of successive economic shocks, 
a significant part of the adjustment has been achieved through the rationalisation of 
revenue expenditure. The revenue expenditure has moderated from 13.6 per cent of 
GDP in FY22 to 10.9 per cent in FY25, which is lower than the pre-pandemic average of 
11.1 per cent of GDP, thereby creating space for more productive capital expenditure.
2.25	A large share of revenue expenditure, covering salaries, pensions, interest payments, 
and defence, is committed in nature, highlighting the importance of rationalising 
discretionary spending, particularly subsidies, to create fiscal space. Expenditure on 
major subsidies (See Table II.4), which rose during the pandemic, declined from 1.9 per 
cent of GDP in FY22 to 1.2 per cent in FY25 and is budgeted at 1.1 per cent of GDP in 
FY26. This consolidation has been achieved alongside a continued commitment to food 
security, with about 78.9 crore beneficiaries receiving free food grains as of October 
2025.15

2.26 In addition to streamlining the design of subsidy schemes, efficiency gains from 
the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) framework have played a key role in reducing subsidy 
outlays by curbing fiscal leakages, estimated at ₹3.48 lakh crore over the past decade.16 
These gains have been made possible by improved targeting, even as beneficiary coverage 
expanded nearly sixteen-fold from about 11 crore to 176 crore over the past decade. The 
efficiency gains are evident across major schemes, including PDS, MGNREGA17, PM-
KISAN and fertiliser subsidies.18 An issue that remains to be addressed is cross-subsidy 
in the railway traffic and power sectors (See Box II.3). 
For FY23, freight earnings accounted for about 68 per cent of the gross traffic receipts of 
Railways, largely reliant on coal transportation. The profit from freight traffic was utilised to 
offset the loss on passenger and other services, leaving an uncovered loss of ₹5257 crore from 
passenger operations19. CAG20 has recommended critically analysing the cost of passenger

Accordingly, the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2025, was introduced to address deep-
rooted inefficiencies, alleviate financial strain on the power sector, promote competition, 
and optimise network costs across India’s power distribution sector. It aims to transform 
the existing market structure by rationalising cross-subsidies, promoting cost-reflective 
tariffs, and enabling direct power procurement by industrial users. It mandates that the 
tariff must reflect the cost of supplying electricity.  It also requires that cross-subsidies 
paid by manufacturing enterprises, railways, and metro railways must be fully eliminated 
within five years.23 Going forward, a balanced approach could include rationalising tariffs 
for subsidised categories by introducing phased rates and quotas, as well as voluntary and 
category- based exclusions.
2.27	Interest payments, another major component of the Centre’s revenue expenditure, 
increased from an average of about 3.1 per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic years to 
around 3.4 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic period, reflecting higher borrowing 
undertaken to support economic recovery during the pandemic. Interest payments 
account for approximately 36.8 per cent of the net revenue receipts to the Centre24 in 
FY25(PA). Going forward, interest costs are expected to be contained through active 
debt management measures being undertaken by the Government, such as switch 
and buyback operations, and calibrated issuance across the yield curve. In parallel, 
sustained direct and indirect tax reforms are expected to strengthen revenue flows in 
the medium term, thereby directly reducing incremental borrowing requirements and, 
in turn, the interest burden as fiscal consolidation progresses. 
2.28	The government could also adopt measures to enhance the efficiency of its 
collections by making them real-time (such as requiring banks to remit TDS on a real-
time basis instead of in batches) and, if necessary, engage a treasury manager to invest 
its short-term surpluses in liquid instruments, thereby earning more return on its 
cash balances. The Government has already undertaken significant process reforms to 
improve the efficiency, timing, and transparency of fund releases, and while incurring 
expenditures, details of some of which are outlined in Box II.4 below.
The Central Government has undertaken a major public financial management reform by 
shifting to a Just-in-Time (JIT) fund release system to improve cash management, reduce 
idle balances, enhance transparency, and strengthen expenditure efficiency. This reform

replaces the earlier credit-push model of bulk fund releases with a debit-pull model, under 
which funds are released only when expenditure is incurred. JIT has been implemented 
through two key initiatives:
SNA-SPARSH (Single Nodal Account-Samyochit Pranali Ekikrit Shighra Hastantaran) for 
Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and TSA Hybrid 
models for Central Sector (CS) schemes.
The reform was necessitated by large idle balances parked with implementing agencies, 
averaging about ₹1.6 lakh crore under CSS, leading to inefficiencies, fund diversion risks, 
and high opportunity costs (particularly when government borrowing rates are around 7 per 
cent per annum). Launched in 2023, SNA-SPARSH enables JIT release of the Central share of 
CSS directly from RBI accounts against actual expenditure based on prior mother sanctions 
issued, thereby eliminating bulk transfers and preventing fund diversion. Integrated with 
Public Financial Management System (PFMS), State FMIS, and RBl's e-Kuber, it now 
covers all 28 States, 3 UTs, and 73 CSS including umbrella schemes (as of 15.01.2026). SNA 
balances declined sharply from ₹1.67 lakh crore in April 2024 to ₹1.22 lakh crore in April 
2025 and to about ₹0.4 lakh crore as on 15.01.2026, generating significant interest savings 
and reducing reliance on short-term borrowings.
For Central Sector schemes, TSA extends JIT principles by eliminating advance transfers to 
implementing agencies, with funds drawn directly from RBI accounts through assignment 
limits. From FY25, all CS schemes with outlays of ₹100 crore or more are covered. The 
TSA Hybrid model addresses schemes involving private or lower-tier agencies by ensuring 
immediate, JIT transfers for payments. As on 15.01.2026 for FY26, 157 schemes are covered 
under TSA CS, with assignments of ₹3.09 lakh crores issued and ₹2.45 lakh crores of 
expenditure incurred. For TSA OCE (other central expenditure), the number of schemes 
covered stands at 93, with assignments of ₹0.9 lakh crore issued and ₹0.79 lakh crores of 
expenditure incurred, alongside substantial savings in interest costs.
Tech-driven solutions in the Public Distribution System (PDS) supply chain
Route Optimisation in the Public Distribution System (RO-PDS) in India is a strategic initiative 
to improve efficiency and reduce costs by using optimisation algorithms developed by IIT-
Delhi and the UN World Food Programme. These algorithms define optimal warehouse-to-
warehouse and warehouse-to-Fair Price Shop (FPS) routes, lowering transportation costs, 
saving time, and ensuring timely delivery of food grains through operations research.
Within a year, route optimisation assessments were completed across 31 States/Union 
Territories (UTs), with estimated annual transportation savings of about ₹250 crore. 
Interstate optimisation for moving food grains from surplus to deficit states was also 
achieved by integrating the Freight Operating Information System (FOIS) of Centre for 
Railway Information Systems (CRIS) with the indigenous PM Gati Shakti Master Plan 
Platform for distance optimisation.
The initiative delivers both economic and environmental benefits. Since food miles contribute 
nearly one-fifth of global food system emissions, optimising PDS routes helps reduce fuel

use and CO₂ emissions, supporting India’s Paris Agreement and COP commitments, 
conserving foreign exchange, and promoting a climate-smart food supply chain. States 
reduced average transport distances by up to 50 per cent and CO₂ emissions by up to 35 per 
cent.
Building on these results, optimisation plans for the Kharif Marketing Season 2025–26 
have been developed for 10 paddy-procuring states. RO-PDS also seeks to minimise human 
intervention that increases costs and pilferage. State governments have been provided the 
Anna Chakra Optimisation Tools, while FCI has received the Rake Optimisation Tool to 
automate and optimise grain supply chain decisions nationwide, aligned with the PM Gati 
Shakti initiative.
Capital expenditure
2.29	The Centre has progressively scaled up capital expenditure from an average of 1.7 
per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period to an average of 2.9 per cent of GDP in 
the years after the pandemic (Chart II.5). At the same time, effective capex, a broader 
measure which includes capital expenditure along with grants-in-aid for the creation 
of capital assets, increased from an average of 2.7 per cent of GDP to 3.9 per cent of 
GDP over the same period, and further to 4 percent in FY25 (PA). These grants-in-
aid have supported asset creation in key areas, including urban and housing affairs, 
the Jal Jeevan Mission, and rural development. The sustained expansion of the capital 
component, achieved alongside declining revenue and fiscal deficits, reflects a deliberate 
rebalancing of expenditure towards asset-creating outlays (Chart II.6).

2.30	Emphasis on asset creation is also reflected in the composition of capital expenditure 
across key infrastructure sectors. Road transport and highways, along with railways, 
continued to account for over half of total capital expenditure through FY25(PA). At the 
same time, allocations towards transfers to States, telecommunications, and housing 
and urban affairs recorded robust double-digit growth, leading to a higher share for 
these sectors in overall capex.
2.31	During the current fiscal year, capex recorded a strong rebound, rising by 28 per 
cent YoY as of the end of November 2025 (Chart II.7). This amounted to nearly 59 per 
cent of the budgeted allocation for capex, which was in line with the trends in FY24 
(FY25 had a lower expenditure rate in the first half as it was an election year). On 
the other hand, revenue expenditure grew by only 1.8 per cent during the first eight 
months of the year, reflecting a continued commitment to fiscal consolidation. Total 
expenditure as a share of Budget Estimates was broadly in line with the performance 
observed during the same period in the past two years.

2.32 As of November 2025, the revenue deficit has reached 68.2 per cent of the budget

for the year. (Chart II.8)

OVERVIEW OF STATE GOVERNMENT FINANCES
Expanding Centre-State transfers through tax devolution and Finance 
Commission grants
2.33	Fiscal transfers from the Centre to the States constitute an important component 
of the overall fiscal landscape. Transfer of funds from the Centre to the States comprises 
the share of States in Central taxes devolved to the States, Finance Commission Grants, 
CSS, and other transfers. The total transfer of resources from the Centre to the States 
has increased significantly in recent years, more than doubling between FY20, the last 
year of the Fourteenth Finance Commission (XIV-FC) award period, and FY26 (BE). In 
GDP terms, total transfers rose from 5.7 per cent to 6.9 per cent over the period, and in 
absolute terms from ₹11.5 lakh crore to ₹25.6 lakh crore (Table II.6). 
₹1,47,827 crore as grants-in-aid to States under Article 275 of the Constitution. These 
grants comprise post-devolution revenue deficit grants, grants to local bodies (including 
health sector grants), and disaster management grants (Table II.7). The utilisation of 
these grants has implications on the growth trajectory of the States, as discussed in 
Box II.5.

Economic Survey 2025-26

58
Fiscal devolution is a core feature of India’s intergovernmental fiscal architecture. Transfers 
from the Centre expand the fiscal space available to States, but their contribution to growth 
depends on prevailing fiscal conditions and, more importantly, on how these resources are 
deployed. Evidence from long-term State-level analysis by the Maharashtra Institution 
for Transformation (MITRA) over 1980-81 to 2022-23 indicates that higher transfers, by 
themselves, do not automatically generate faster growth in lower-income States; the growth 
payoff is mediated by expenditure composition and fiscal discipline.
After accounting for structural and fiscal differences including initial income levels, capital 
outlay, aggregate grants, fiscal deficits and human capital indicators, the analysis finds 
capital expenditure to be the most consistent and statistically significant driver of per capita 
income growth. States that devote a larger share of resources to capital formation tend to 
record stronger growth outcomes even after controlling for other factors, underscoring the 
persistent productivity effects of public investment.
By contrast, the aggregate volume of grants does not show a stable or robust association with 
growth when examined in isolation, suggesting that the impact of fiscal devolution hinges 
less on the magnitude of transfers and more on their deployment. Higher fiscal deficits 
are associated with weaker subsequent growth, highlighting the macro-stability costs of 
undisciplined borrowing, while improvements in human capital translate more effectively 
into growth when accompanied by complementary investment and employment generation.
Taken together, the evidence indicates that what ultimately matters for household welfare is 
not merely the flow of transfers but the conversion of public resources into productive assets 
and opportunities. Capital expenditure, by improving infrastructure, reducing transaction 
costs, crowding-in private investment and supporting employment, delivers more durable 
gains in household incomes and living standards than short-term, transfer-led approaches. 
While cash or grant-heavy spending can ease near-term constraints, it does not, on its own, 
create the productivity improvements needed for broad-based income growth. The findings 
therefore underline the importance of protecting capital spending, strengthening investment 
execution capacity, and aligning fiscal devolution with growth-enhancing public investment 
so that convergence rests on lasting improvements in incomes and human welfare rather 
than transient redistribution.
Enhanced borrowing limits for the States
2.35 The XV-FC has recommended a Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC) of 3 per cent of GSDP 
for the States in FY26. In addition, States may avail performance-linked additional 
borrowing of up to 0.5 per cent of GSDP for the power sector, over and above the normal 
borrowing ceiling. This dispensation, originally applicable from FY21 to FY25 and later 
extended to FY26, is linked to improving the operational and economic efficiency of the 
sector and promoting a sustained increase in paid electricity consumption.
2.36	Furthermore, States are permitted to borrow over and above their normal 
borrowing limits by an amount equal to the pension contributions (both employer’s

59
59
and employees’) that they deposit under the National Pension System (NPS) with the 
designated authority (NSDL or the trustee bank). For FY26, this translates into an 
additional borrowing space of ₹69,769 crore (as of November 17, 2025). This additional 
borrowing is intended to address the divergence in pension accounting across States, 
whereby those following a ‘pay-as-you-go’ system report lower fiscal deficits, as their 
future pension liabilities are not explicitly reflected, whereas states following the NPS 
incur a current expenditure that enlarges their fiscal deficit. 
Performance of State Finances
Increasing revenue and fiscal deficit while capex remains intact
2.37	The combined fiscal deficit of State Governments, as a proportion of GDP, has, on 
average, remained broadly stable at around 2.8 per cent in the post-pandemic period, 
similar to pre-pandemic levels. However, after the sharp correction from the pandemic-
induced spike of around 3.9 per cent, State deficits have gradually edged up again over 
the past three years to 3.2 per cent, reflecting emerging pressures on State finances. 
Excluding SASCI - the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment, 
under which the Centre provides 50‑year interest‑free loans to states exclusively for 
capital expenditure – the fiscal deficit is back in the range of 2.8 per cent.

2.38	Between FY19 and FY25PA, 18 States saw a deterioration in their revenue balances, 
of which 10 slipped into revenue deficit from revenue surplus, 5 worsened their revenue 
deficit and 3 managed to stay in revenue surplus despite a deterioration. Overall, states 
in revenue surplus reduced from 19 in FY19 to 11 in FY25(PA) leading to an overall

increase in revenue deficit of states as a collective, to 0.7 per cent from 0.1 per cent 
of GDP in FY19. Further, between FY24 and FY25PA, the revenue deficit increased 
by 40 basis points across all states. A key driver of this renewed fiscal stress has been 
lagging revenue growth relative to nominal GDP growth, compounded by the incurring 
of expenditures such as discretionary unconditional cash transfers.

own tax revenue in total revenue receipts increased from 46 per cent in FY22 to about

revenues.

2.40	Total revenue receipts of States, as a percentage of GDP, declined from about 13.3 
per cent in FY22 to 12.2 per cent in FY25(PA), thereby constraining fiscal space at the 
combined State level. In this environment where revenues are not matching the pace of 
nominal GDP growth, the Central Government has extended interest-free loans to States 
to safeguard capital expenditure. Allocations under SASCI increased sharply from about 
₹12,000 crore in FY21 to around ₹1.5 lakh crore in FY26. As a result, notwithstanding the 
rise in revenue deficits, capital expenditure by States as a share of GDP remained broadly 
stable at about 2.4 per cent, underscoring the role of SASCI in protecting growth-oriented 
spending amid fiscal pressures.27 (See Box II.6).
27	Conversely, since SASCI is linked to capital expenditure, States may be increasingly reallocating their own 
resources toward revenue expenditure.

A major boost to States’ fiscal capacity in recent years has come from the Central Government’s 
Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure (SASCI). Launched in 
October 2020 in the wake of the pandemic, the scheme provides 50-year interest-free loans 
to support State-level capital expenditure, recognising its high multiplier effects and role in 
crowding in private investment. Reflecting strong uptake and positive feedback from States, 
the scheme has been continued with progressively higher allocations from FY22 to FY26, 
resulting in total uptake of ₹4,49,845 crore from FY21 to FY26 (till 04.01.2026). The scheme 
consists of two parts, with a tied and an untied component. 
SASCI strikes a balance between a flexible and a reform-oriented approach. In FY26, 
out of the allotted ₹150,000 crore, around ₹68,000 crore has been allocated as 
untied assistance, enabling States and UTs to undertake priority capital projects of 
their choice, while ₹80,000 crore is earmarked for reform-linked and sector-specific 
investments. An additional ₹2,000 crore has been allocated to support States that 
have faced exceptional revenue shortfalls in recent years. This structure enables 
states to sustain investment momentum while advancing reforms that enhance 
efficiency and medium-term growth potential.
SASCI has played a stabilising role in sustaining State capital expenditure amid 
pressures on the revenue account. The overall capital outlay of States increased 
from 2.17 per cent of GDP in FY22 to 2.37 per cent in FY25(PA); however, excluding 
SASCI-linked capital spending, States’ capex declined from 2.11 per cent to 1.92 per 
cent of GDP over the same period. The scheme has therefore helped States avoid a 
pro-cyclical compression of public investment. States with lower per capita incomes 
have relied more heavily on SASCI to finance capital outlay, reaffirming its role in 
supporting fiscally constrained States to achieve convergence with the high-income

63
states. By sustaining investment and incentivising reforms, SASCI strengthens 
productive capacity, enhances future revenue potential, and supports medium-term 
fiscal health.
2.41	On the expenditure side, total expenditure of States, as a share of GDP, moderated 
marginally from 15.7 per cent in FY19 to 15.4 per cent in FY24 (Chart II.14). Revenue 
expenditure continues to account for the bulk of State spending, although its share 
declined modestly from 86 per cent in FY19 to 84 per cent in FY24 (Chart II.15). 
Within revenue expenditure, however, the composition has undergone a notable shift, 
with an increasing tilt towards unconditional cash transfers and other committed 
outlays. As these transfers absorb a rising share of available fiscal space, the scope for 
expanding productive capital expenditure becomes increasingly constrained, especially 
in an environment of limited revenues and elevated deficits. The fiscal trade-offs and 
medium-term implications of this trend are examined in Box II.7.

Economic Survey 2025-26

Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) have expanded rapidly across several States and 
now form a growing share of State-level welfare spending. Aggregate spending on UCT 
programmes, particularly for women, is estimated at approximately ₹1.7 lakh crore for FY26. 
The number of States implementing them increased more than fivefold between FY23 and 
FY26, with around half of these States estimated to be in revenue deficit.28 Singh (2025)29 
assessed such transfers to be in the range of 0.19 per cent to 1.25 per cent of GSDP and 
of GDP in FY22 to 3.2 per cent in FY25PA, while the combined revenue deficit increased 
from 0.4 per cent to 0.7 per cent of GDP, indicating continued borrowing to finance revenue 
expenditure. Outstanding liabilities stood at about 28.1 per cent of GDP in FY25. Committed 
expenditures i.e., salaries, pensions, interest payments, and subsidies, absorbed about 62 
per cent of States’ revenue receipts in FY24, leaving limited fiscal room.
In this context, higher allocations to UCTs involve clear trade-offs. Unless deficits widen 
further, additional spending will crowd out resources for critical social and physical 
infrastructure. But deficits cannot widen any further without causing further deterioration 
in the overall financial health of the state. These trade-offs are reinforced by programme 
design: many schemes lack sunset clauses or periodic reviews, increasing rigidity in 
revenue expenditure. As a result, capital expenditure, whose growth impact is stronger 
and more durable, often becomes the casualty when fiscal pressures intensify, with adverse 
implications for medium-term growth.
Evidence supports these concerns. A recent NBER meta-analysis34 covering 115 randomised 
evaluations across 72 UCT programmes in 34 low- and middle-income countries finds that 
while UCTs improve consumption, food security, and short-term income stability, they do 
not consistently improve child nutrition, educational outcomes, or enable sustained exits 
from poverty. Such outcomes depend critically on complementary public services and 
employment opportunities, underscoring that UCTs are not substitutes for investments in 
health, education, nutrition, childcare, or growth-enhancing public expenditure.
Several countries have linked cash transfers to clear, verifiable actions by beneficiaries, 
rather than providing open-ended income support. In Mexico’s Progresa/Oportunidades35,
31 except Jharkhand, where it is more than 100 per cent, due to the higher value of the transfer in Jharkhand, as well 
as the relatively lower average MPCE of the State.

families received cash only if children attended school regularly and pregnant women and 
young children visited health clinics for check-ups and nutrition monitoring. Payments 
were stopped if these conditions were not met, and households were periodically reassessed. 
Brazil’s Bolsa Famíli36a followed a similar approach: continued eligibility required minimum 
school attendance and compliance with basic health requirements such as immunisation and 
maternal care. These conditions ensured that public spending directly supported education, 
health, and nutrition outcomes, not just consumption.
Some programmes also have built-in exit or review mechanisms. In the Philippines’ Pantawid 
Pamilyang Pilipino Program, benefits were time-limited and subject to regular reassessment, 
with families expected to “graduate” once conditions improved. In contrast, a few pilots went 
further: the Opportunity NYC programme37 in the United States was explicitly designed as a 
time-bound experiment, where families earned cash rewards for meeting education, health, 
and work-related targets, and the programme ended after evaluation. These experiences 
show that cash support can be designed as conditional, review-based, and time-bound, 
reducing long-term fiscal rigidity while strengthening human capital outcomes-features 
largely absent in fully unconditional transfer schemes.
Taken together, these considerations argue for careful reprioritisation within State budgets. 
Preserving fiscal space for capital formation and human-capital investment yields stronger 
and more persistent gains in household incomes, labour productivity, and welfare than a 
steady expansion of open-ended UCTs. While the Centre’s incentives have supported higher 
State capital outlays in recent years, sustaining growth will depend on complementary 
discipline within revenue expenditure, so that short-term income support does not erode 
the very investments on which inclusive, medium-term prosperity ultimately rests.
Trends in State’s receipts and expenditures in FY26
2.42 During the current fiscal year (as on end November 2025), the revenue collection 
as a proportion of budget estimates has shown a moderation (Chart II.16) compared 
to the previous two years across most of the major categories of revenue (Chart II.17).38 
The combined revenue receipts of the states have grown at a rate of 6.6 per cent during 
the first eight months of the year, which is lower than the YoY growth of the previous 
year.

2.44	The Central Government’s debt management strategy is anchored in three guiding 
principles: maintaining a low and stable cost of borrowing, mitigating risks associated 
with maturity (rollover risk), interest rates and currency exposure, and supporting 
the development of government securities markets. Since the pandemic, the gradual 
consolidation of debt has reinforced the credibility of fiscal policy, even as global public 
debt levels have continued to rise. The Government’s medium-term goal to achieve a debt-
to-GDP ratio of 50 ± 1 per cent by FY31 reflects a deliberate effort to strengthen overall debt 
sustainability while preserving policy flexibility in an uncertain global environment. Box II.8 
provides a detailed discussion of the fiscal policy framework for the Central Government.

In the year of the pandemic, the fiscal deficit of the Central Government reached 9.2 per 
cent of GDP, partly on account of pandemic-related and induced expenditure and to a 
determination to bring below-the-line budget expenditures above the line. It also aimed to 
draw a line under such practices in the future. At the time, the finance minister committed 
to reducing the Central Government’s fiscal deficit ratio by at least half in five years. The 
government has targeted a fiscal deficit of 4.4 per cent for FY26 and is on course to achieve 
it, thus fulfilling the commitment made in FY21. It is noteworthy that the government was 
determined to and succeeded in bringing down the fiscal deficit ratio as promised, despite 
it not being a legislative target, even while improving the quality of fiscal expenditure with 
a concurrent emphasis on capital expenditure. Among other things, the conservative and 
prudent approach to fiscal management, which enhanced fiscal credibility, led to India’s 
sovereign rating upgrades by several credit rating agencies in FY26.
In the FY26 budget announced in February 2025, the government outlined a new fiscal 
glide path, aiming to reduce the Central Government’s debt-to-GDP ratio to around 50 per 
cent by FY31. The choice of the debt-to-GDP ratio as the fiscal anchor was consistent with 
global thinking. It was also considered a more reliable measure of the government’s fiscal 
performance, as it captures the cumulative effect of past and current fiscal decisions. 
There is a perception that the government should consider reinstating the Fiscal 
Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) framework, first enunciated in 2003 as 
the FRBM Act, and commit to a fiscal deficit target of 3 per cent of GDP for the Central 
Government. While it appears prima facie appropriate, in the highly uncertain current 
global environment, it is important to retain greater policy freedom and commit to targets 
that the government can deliver on. Since the FRBM Act was first enacted in 2003, the 3 
per cent target has been achieved only once. This eroded India’s fiscal credibility, and it has 
taken five years of sustained commitment to fiscal prudence post-Covid to win back the 
trust of financial markets and credit-rating agencies. It is important to retain that trust. 
In this regard, the new fiscal policy framework has announced a debt ratio target of 50±1 per 
cent by 31st March 2031, which meets the requirements. It is a concrete commitment with 
a specific date. Yet it affords the government flexibility to fine-tune fiscal policy in response 
to emerging needs in the intervening period, in a volatile and unpredictable geopolitical 
and geoeconomic environment. Once the current target is met and fiscal deficits decline 
gradually, a new FRBM target may be considered at the end of the Sixteenth Finance 
Commission period. A return to a rule-based regime will likely be credible and durable if 
ushered in after a period of lower global macro uncertainty and after debt and/or deficit 
ratios come meaningfully closer to 50 per cent or 3 per cent of GDP, respectively.
Low Cost of Borrowing and Strategic Issuance

considering the absorptive capacity of the market and containing the borrowing costs.

government liabilities (around 65 per cent)43. This composition has enabled effective 
transmission of domestic macro-financial conditions to government borrowing costs, 
which have benefited from favourable domestic conditions, including easing inflation, 
strong growth, and supportive liquidity.
2.46	During the year, the primary auctions for Government securities were largely 
conducted smoothly in line with the notified borrowing calendar. Nearly half of the 
issuances (about 47 per cent of total issuances) were concentrated in bonds maturing 
beyond 10 years. This provided the necessary support for managing rollover risk. 
Overall, the weighted average maturity (WAM) of borrowings stood at about 19.14 
years in FY26 so far, compared with 20.66 years in FY25. The weighted average coupon 
(WAC) of fresh issuances during FY26 (as on 19 January 2026) has declined to 6.65 per 
cent as compared to 7.11 per cent in FY25. Over the longer term, the weighted average 
coupon on outstanding debt has fallen from 7.71 per cent in FY20 to 7.25 per cent in 
FY25.
2.47 As on 8 January 2026, the sovereign bond yield curve has a steeper profile, marked 
by a jump in yields in the medium to longer maturities, while short-term rates fell in 
response to the policy rate cuts similar to the scenario in January 2020. Given global 
uncertainties and reduced demand for longer-maturity bonds by domestic institutional 
investors due to portfolio rebalancing, yields on long-dated securities increased, 
further widening term spreads. Despite volatile global conditions, the weighted average 
yield on new government securities declined from 7.14 per cent in Q1 FY25 to 6.48 per 
cent in Q1 FY26. Strategic issuance across maturities, supported by active cash and 
liquidity management, has helped smooth borrowing costs and limit yield volatility. 
The weighted average borrowing cost of G-secs issued in FY26 stands at 6.65 per cent 
so far compared to 6.96 per cent in FY25.
43 Marketable securities constitute 65.6 per cent of the outstanding batch of government liabilities as published in 
the Union Budget and 64.6 per cent as per FRBM-based accounting.

2.48	Rollover, interest rate, and foreign currency risks have been effectively contained 
through a prudent debt management strategy. Rollover risk has been reduced by 
consciously elongating maturities, supported by switch and buyback operations, with 
the weighted average maturity of fresh issuances remaining around 19 years, and that of 
outstanding dated securities rising to 13.66 years in FY25. Consequently, only 27.0 per 
cent of outstanding debt is set to mature over the next five years, implying an average 
annual rollover of about 5.4 per cent, indicating manageable refinancing needs. Interest 
rate risk has been limited by maintaining a predominantly fixed-rate debt profile, with 
floating-rate debt accounting for just 4.1 per cent of outstanding debt at end-FY24, 
ensuring predictability of interest costs. Foreign currency risk remains low due to the 
country's reliance on domestic currency borrowing, with external debt accounting for 
a small share of liabilities, (approximately 2.6 per cent of GDP) largely sourced from 
multilateral institutions on long-term, concessional terms, thereby insulating public 
debt from exchange rate and external shocks.
States’ Debt
2.49	The debt-GSDP ratio and the interest payments to revenue receipts (IP/RR) 
ratio are key variables in assessing the fiscal health of States. A sustainable level of 
debt helps promote intergenerational equity, especially when it finances investments. 
Similarly, a relatively lower IP/RR ratio allows for greater fiscal space in undertaking 
productive expenditure, catering to other committed expenditure and maintaining 
revenue balance. The combined debt-GSDP ratio of States and UTs has been on an 
increasing trajectory in the last decade. After peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
it experienced consolidation, culminating in a slight uptick in FY25. For 28 States 
combined, while the debt-to-GDP ratio is 28.1 and the interest payments-to-revenue 
receipts ratio is approximately 12.6 for FY25(PA), there exists considerable variation 
on both fronts across States.  
2.50	While debt-GSDP and IP/RR ratios highlight wide differences in fiscal health 
across States, these differences are not yet adequately reflected in State borrowing costs. 
Evidence from the State Development Loan (SDL) market44 indicates that SDLs are 
predominantly held by domestic institutions, with limited secondary market trading. 
States have increasingly shifted from standard 10-year SDL issuances to a wider range of 
longer maturities. However, secondary market trading continues to reflect state-specific 
preferences rather than meaningful risk-based price differentiation. There appears to 
be only a weak differentiation between SDL coupons and fiscal health. In other words, 
borrowing costs do not sufficiently reward fiscally stronger States or penalise weaker 
ones. In this context, the XV-FC has emphasised the disclosure of States' financial 
positions, which would allow markets to better assess and price State-specific credit risk.

This can be achieved by improving the timeliness, granularity, and standardisation of 
State-level fiscal data, particularly on off-budget liabilities, guarantees, and contingent 
risks. Broadening the investor base and enhancing secondary market liquidity would 
lead to better pricing of SDLs.  
GENERAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES
2.51	General government finances provide an overview of the fiscal position of the 
centre and states, when taken together and after netting out certain central transfers. 
Mirroring trends in central government debt, general government deficits and liabilities, 
which remained above pre-pandemic levels, have followed a consolidation path in the 
post-pandemic period. As the Central Government continues fiscal consolidation over 
the medium term, the general government is also expected to remain on a consolidation 
trajectory.
2.52	Globally, general government debt ratios remained elevated in the post-pandemic 
period, with advanced economies (AEs) continuing to carry structurally higher debt 
burdens than emerging market economies (EMEs)45. While AEs deployed larger counter-
cyclical support during the pandemic and have since seen only limited debt unwinding, 
EMEs face persistent fiscal pressures and more constrained adjustment space. Against 
this backdrop, India stands out among large emerging economies. Despite starting 
from a higher-than-average EME debt level, India has reduced its general government 
debt-to-GDP ratio by about 7.1 percentage points since 2020 (Chart II.24), even as 
growth momentum has been sustained. This places India closer to the post-pandemic 
consolidation path observed in AEs, underscoring that prudent, growth-friendly fiscal 
consolidation is achievable under challenging global conditions.

2.53	Sustainable public debt is crucial for macroeconomic growth. It enables governments 
to leverage borrowings to finance investments that increase productivity, attract private 
capital, and generate higher tax revenues, creating a virtuous cycle that also helps expand 
the production frontier. The Economic Survey of India 2020–21 (Volume 1, Chapter 2: 
“Does Growth Lead to Debt Sustainability? Yes, But Not Vice Versa!”)47 illustrates this 
mechanism for India, showing that sustained high growth has historically delivered a 
favourable interest-rate–growth differential, keeping the debt-to-GDP ratio stable, while 
undertaking fiscal consolidation when warranted. Barro (1990)48 showed theoretically 
and empirically that debt-financed productive government spending (especially on core

infrastructure) permanently raises the steady-state growth rate by increasing the marginal 
product of private capital. In this context, a debt sustainability analysis for India, based 
on the fiscal response function (FRF), is presented in Box II.9.
The modern testing of debt sustainability rests on the fiscal response function (FRF), 
pioneered by Henning Bohn (1998)49. Using over a century of U.S. data, Bohn showed that 
if the primary surplus-to-GDP ratio rises systematically with the lagged debt-to-GDP ratio 
(β > 0), fiscal policy is sustainable regardless of whether interest rate (r) > nominal GDP 
growth (g). This insight shifted the focus from arbitrary debt thresholds to governments’ 
actual behaviour. Subsequent landmark contributions include Ghosh et al. (2013)50, who 
introduced nonlinear (cubic) specifications and the concept of “fiscal fatigue” and “fiscal 
space” in advanced economies; Mauro et al. (2015)51, who documented time-varying and 
occasionally pro-cyclical responses across a broad global panel; and Checherita-Westphal 
and Ždarek (2015)52, who highlighted how EU institutional rules and crises altered the 
strength and symmetry of fiscal reactions in euro-area countries.
To assess the sustainability of debt in the Indian context, the following specification has 
been employed to estimate the fiscal response function for general government in India, for 
the period 1981 to 2024 drawing from Bohn’s work:
Pbt = dt-1 + yvart + gvart + dummyt + εt
Where ‘pbt’ is the primary balance relative to GDP, with a positive value indicating a primary 
surplus and a negative value implying a primary deficit. ‘dt-1’ is the debt-GDP ratio lagged 
one period. ‘yvar’ is the output gap and ‘gvar’ is the government spending gap, estimated 
using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. ‘Dummy’ is the dummy variable to factor in conscious fiscal 
consolidation years, such as post the 1991 reforms, and the implementation period of the Fiscal 
Responsibility and Budget Management Act before the Covid-related easings. Following Bohn, 
the FRF is intentionally estimated in levels, since the economic meaning of sustainability 
resides in levels, and not in differences. Further, since debt is highly autocorrelated and the 
error term often exhibits moving-average serial correlation, Newey-West heteroskedasticity- 
and autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) standard errors are employed.
The estimated fiscal response function provides clear evidence that India’s fiscal policy has 
been sustainable in the Bohn (1998) sense. On average, an increase in the lagged public debt-

to-GDP ratio induces an improvement in the primary balance-to-GDP ratio. This signals that 
Indian fiscal policy has historically been responsive to debt accumulation: when debt rises, 
policymakers eventually adjust revenues or non-interest expenditures to stabilise or reduce 
it. The strongly positive coefficient of yvar indicates counter-cyclical fiscal behaviour, wherein 
primary balance improves significantly when output is above trend, consistent with automatic 
stabilisers. Interpretation for gvar can be understood as follows - when the government 
spending gap (gvar) rises, it reflects a surge in total expenditure above the trend. Consequently, 
the fiscal deficit increases, causing the primary balance to fall into a deficit (represented by 
a negative coefficient of –0.709). This indicates that temporary spending spikes are deficit-
financed, i.e., the government chooses to fund these extras through a "hole in its own purse" 
rather than through other measures like a rise in taxation. However, this behaviour remains 
sustainable because of the positive coefficient for lagged debt (dt-1), which shows that the long-
term corrective response to rising debt ensures that these temporary primary deficits do not 
lead to an infinite debt spiral. The large positive coefficient of the dummy variable indicates 
that institutional reforms and explicit fiscal rules have significantly induced fiscal discipline, 
as reflected in the strengthening of primary balances.
2.54	India’s fiscal model stands out particularly when assessed through the lens of public 
investment efficiency. In FY24, general government investment was 4 per cent of GDP, 
amounting to about one-fifth of total government revenue, much higher than in most 
peer economies. When OECD countries were at income levels similar to India today, 
their general government investment was about 2 to 5 per cent of GDP, even though

their tax revenues were in the range of 20 to 28 per cent of GDP53. A relatively higher 
revenue to public investment ratio, reflects India’s clear focus on growth-enhancing 
capital expenditure.
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
2.55	India’s recent fiscal performance reflects a careful balancing of growth imperatives 
and fiscal prudence. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals have been reinforced by a 
calibrated fiscal strategy that prioritised capital expenditure while steadily consolidating 
deficits and debt. The Centre’s commitment to a transparent and credible medium-term 
debt glide path has enhanced policy credibility, providing fiscal space and flexibility to
