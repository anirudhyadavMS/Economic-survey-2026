INFLATION: TAMED AND 
ANCHORED
This chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of recent trends in global and 
domestic inflation, with a particular focus on the period up to  December 2025. 
Globally, inflation has moderated significantly from its post-pandemic highs, 
with advanced economies stabilising at 2–3 per cent and emerging markets, 
including India, experiencing a notable decrease in the rate of inflation. The 
moderation is attributed to easing commodity prices, particularly in food and 
energy, as well as responsive monetary policies by central banks. India stands 
out for achieving a sharp decline in headline inflation, alongside robust GDP 
growth, reflecting strong macroeconomic fundamentals and effective monetary 
policy.
Domestically, retail inflation (CPI) has followed a clear downward trajectory, 
reaching 1.7 per cent in 2025–26, driven primarily by a steep decline in food 
prices—especially vegetables, pulses, and spices—supported by favourable 
agricultural conditions and timely policy interventions. Core inflation, while 
appearing sticky, is shown to be largely influenced by surges in precious 
metals; when these are excluded, underlying inflationary pressures are more 
subdued. The analysis highlights the critical role of government interventions in 
stabilising food and edible oil prices.
The chapter also explores sectoral price dynamics, noting a long-term decline 
in the terms of trade for manufacturing relative to agriculture, which has 
implications for resource allocation and investment. On the other hand, 
regional inflation patterns reveal greater volatility in rural areas due to higher 
food weights in consumption baskets.  However, overall, state-level inflation 
outcomes have converged within the Reserve Bank of India's tolerance band, 
with few exceptions. The Chapter also examines the drivers of divergence in 
state-level inflation experiences.  
Looking ahead, the outlook remains favourable, with projections of inflation 
staying within target ranges, supported by strong agricultural output, stable 
global commodity prices, and continued policy vigilance. However, risks from 
currency fluctuations, base metal price surges and global uncertainties persist, 
warranting ongoing monitoring and adaptive policy responses.

GLOBAL INFLATION DEVELOPMENTS
5.1.	 The world has seen a broad-based and sustained moderation in inflation across 
advanced, emerging, and developing economies this year. The global headline inflation 
(Chart V. 1) has declined from a peak of 8.7 per cent in calendar year (CY) 2022 to 4.2 
per cent in CY 2025.  Following the post-pandemic surge to 7.3 per cent, inflation rates 
have stabilised in the range of 2-3 per cent in advanced economies (AEs), while they have 
moderated in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) to 5.3 per cent from 
an elevated level of 9.7 per cent. According to IMF records, for the comparable period, 
India recorded an inflation rate of 2.8 per cent, while China continued to experience 
price stagnation.

5.2.	 In the United States, headline inflation declined from 3.0 per cent in 2024 to 2.7 per 
cent in 2025, driven largely by moderating core services inflation, along with continued 
negative inflation in major commodity prices. However, inflationary pressures may 
resurface in the US, with the eventual pass-through of increased tariffs to the final 
consumers and monetary easing by the Fed. Similarly, the Euro region experienced 
a slight moderation in its headline inflation, which declined from 2.3 per cent to 2.1 
per cent this year, driven largely by easing energy and food prices, despite the Russia-
Ukraine war raging in Europe. On the other hand, headline inflation in the United 
Kingdom rose to 3.4 per cent compared to 2.5 per cent in 2024, due to high service 
inflation, as well as pressure from persistent policy rate cuts.  Another outlier, Japan, 
saw a structural shift away from chronic low inflation/deflation toward sustained, 
wage‑driven inflation, with its headline inflation rising from 2.7 per cent in 2024 to 3.3 
per cent in 2025, associated with a weakening of its currency, resulting in higher import 
prices for Japanese staple rice and moderate services inflation.

Monetary Policy responses of global central banks
5.3.	 In response to easing or moderate inflationary pressures and considering the 
domestic growth pangs, central banks in AEs have continued to reduce policy rates 
during the current year, with cumulative cuts ranging from 75 to 100 basis points in 
the UK, the Euro Area, and the United States.1 The Reserve Bank of India, during the 
same period, reduced the policy rate by 125 basis points. The Bank of Japan (BoJ), 
which ended its negative interest rate regime in 2024, remained an outlier among 
major economies by increasing its policy rate by 50 basis points in response to its rising 
inflation. 
Drivers of Global Inflation
5.4.	 Global inflationary pressures could be contained as there was a general decline 
in oil and food prices alongside easing inflation in key commodities (Chart V.2). 
Following the decline in previous years, food prices remained relatively stable in the 
first half of 2025, before dipping into the negative terrain by October 2025. Oil prices 
have decreased by more than 20 per cent compared to the start of the Calendar Year, 
with inflation remaining in the negative zone throughout the year.

5.5.	 Global prices of key metals (Chart V. 3), such as aluminium and copper, declined in 
the first half of 2025 but recovered slowly in the second half of the year. Recently, copper 
prices have been surging due to Data Centre/AI demands, as well as tight supplies. 
For many months, iron remained in the deflationary zone. The subdued inflation in 
these critical commodities has contributed to reduced input costs in several industrial 
goods.

Growth-Inflation Trade-off in EMDEs
5.6.	 While economic growth in a majority of EMDEs remained below the 
EMDE average of 4.2 per cent, inflation outcomes varied widely across countries 
(Chart V. 4). In Brazil, headline inflation rose steadily from 4.4 per cent in 2024 to 5.2 
per cent in 2025, before easing in subsequent months as service inflation moderated. 
Russia experienced subdued GDP growth alongside persistently high inflation, 
reflecting the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and related trade sanctions. In contrast, 
inflation moderated in several major Southeast Asian economies, including Malaysia, 
Indonesia, and the Philippines, supported by lower imported commodity costs. Notably, 
China experienced significant deflation during the year, driven by weak domestic 
demand, export pressures arising from tariff regimes, and excess capacity in several 
manufacturing industries, which kept producer prices in negative territory.

5.7.	 Among major EMDEs, India has recorded one of the sharpest declines in headline 
inflation, amounting to about 1.8 percentage points (Chart V. 5). Importantly, this 
disinflation has occurred alongside robust GDP growth of 8 per cent in the H1 of 
FY26, underscoring India’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals and its ability to 
sustain growth while effectively managing price pressures, or in other words, without 
overheating. While upgrading India’s sovereign rating, global rating agencies have 
also acknowledged the credibility and effectiveness of India's inflation management.
For instance, S&P observed that “Monetary policy reform to switch to inflation targeting 
has reaped dividends. Inflationary expectations are better anchored than they were a 
decade ago. Between 2008 and 2014, India's inflation reached double-digits on numerous 
occasions. In the past three years, despite volatility in global energy prices and supply-side 
shocks, CPI growth averaged 5.5 per cent. In recent months, it stayed at the lower bound of 
the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) target range of 2-6 per cent. These developments, coupled 
with a deep domestic capital market, reflect a more stable and supportive environment for 
monetary settings.”

DOMESTIC INFLATION
Sustained moderation in retail inflation 
5.8.	 Over the past four years, average retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer 
Price Index (CPI), has followed a clear downward trajectory (Chart V.6), declining 
steadily from 6.7 per cent in the financial year (FY) 2022–23 to 1.7 per cent in 2025–26 
(up to December). The pace of disinflation was particularly pronounced in the current 
year, given that inflation was at 4.6 per cent in 2024–25. In fact, April-December 2025 
marked the lowest average inflation rate in the current CPI series. The factory-gate basic

price for producers, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)-based inflation, 
has consistently been lower than CPI inflation in these years and has mirrored the 
broad disinflationary trend, while exerting a moderating effect on the CPI.

5.9.	 The current disinflationary phase commenced in October 2024, when retail inflation 
stood at 6.2 per cent. During the first half of 2025–26 (H1 of FY26), headline inflation 
declined sharply from 3.2 per cent in April 2025 to 1.4 per cent in September 2025, averaging 
2.2 per cent over the period. Inflation eased further to 0.3 per cent in October 2025—the 
lowest reading in the current CPI (2012=100) series. This disinflation was driven primarily 
by the food items, reflecting favourable weather conditions and higher production that 
boosted supply (Chart V. 7). In contrast, core inflation—which excludes volatile components 
such as food and fuel—remained relatively stable and has shown a modest uptick during 
this period, rising from 3.8 per cent in October 2024 to 4.62 per cent in December 2025.

Softening Core, if precious metals are excluded
5. 10.	 The apparent divergence between headline and core inflation creates an 
impression of sticky core inflation, suggesting that underlying price pressures are 
firming even as headline inflation softens. The average reading of core inflation indeed 
shows an increase from 3.5 per cent in FY25 to about 4.3 per cent in FY26 (or a rise from 
3.19 per cent in April 2024 to 4.62 per cent in December 2025), indicating persistence 
in non-food, non-fuel inflation. However, a more granular assessment reveals that this 
persistence is largely driven by sharp increases in the prices of precious metals—gold 
and silver—which have touched lifetime highs amid heightened global uncertainty 
and strong safe-haven demand. When these components are excluded, core inflation 
exhibits a declining trajectory, broadly mirroring the moderation in headline inflation 
(Chart V. 8). The resulting wedge between usual core inflation and these adjusted core 
measures amounts to approximately 235 basis points (excluding only precious metals) 
and 226 basis points (excluding both precious metals and the effects of petrol and diesel 
prices on the core). Notably, between June and December, core inflation excluding 
precious metals decelerated from 3.4 per cent to 2.3 per cent, even as the standard 
core measure remained elevated at around 4.6 per cent. This divergence indicates 
that the recent firmness in core inflation primarily reflects price pressures from 
precious metals rather than a broad-based strengthening of underlying inflationary 
momentum.

Dominance of the base effect
5.11.		 Inflation can be decomposed into two components: the momentum effect and 
the base effect. The momentum effect captures the month-on-month price changes in 
the current year, while the base effect reflects the influence of price movements in the 
corresponding months of the previous year on year-on-year inflation. In FY26, the base 
effect played a dominant role in shaping the inflation trajectory, with its downward 
influence outweighing the momentum effect in seven out of nine months, thereby 
exerting significant disinflationary pressure (Chart V. 9). Although price pressures 
did emerge during the year, they were relatively contained and confined to a few 
months.

Drivers of Food Disinflation 
5.12.		 As shown in Chart V. 7, food inflation experienced a steady decline throughout the 
year, entering deflationary territory since June 2025. In fact, October 2025 witnessed 
the biggest monthly decline of (-) 5.02 per cent in the present CPI series. The sharp 
moderation was driven primarily by a sustained and steep decline in vegetable prices, 
which remained deeply negative for much of the year, alongside a continuous fall in 
pulses inflation over nearly nine months (Chart V.10). Spice prices also remained in 
deflation for an extended period of 18 months, though the magnitude of decline was 
relatively modest. Inflation in cereals had been declining throughout the year, from 6.2 
per cent in January 2025 to merely (-) 0.4 per cent in December 2025. Together, these 
trends in key food components contributed significantly to the unprecedented easing of 
overall price pressures during the year.

5.13.		 Prior to the recent moderation, pulse prices had remained elevated for several 
months during 2023 and 2024, reflecting production shortfalls and low carry-forward 
stocks that exerted significant upward pressure on prices. With domestic production 
recovering, supported by stable imports and an improved stock position, pulse’s 
inflation began to ease in the current year.
5.14.		 Given that India’s pulses market is structurally characterised by excess demand, 
the Government closely monitors mandi prices using analytical tools to obtain early 
signals of price movements, enabling timely policy responses to pre-empt retail price 
volatility. In this context, considering the expansion in tur acreage, procurement of 
6.5 lakh metric tonnes in the previous season, and higher global exportable surplus, 
an import duty of 30 per cent on yellow peas, (a close substitute product for chana) 
was imposed in October 2025—ahead of the chana sowing season—to safeguard farmer 
interests, support domestic prices, and avoid sharp price corrections. Similarly, imports 
of masoor and chana (Bengal gram) are currently subject to a 10 per cent import duty. 
5.15.		 Overall, timely trade policy decisions, strategic buffer stock management, and 
targeted market interventions have enabled effective management of the pulses price 
cycle, with retail price volatility moderating over the past decade, even in years of 
production shortfall.  The degree of volatility in prices of pulses has been much lower 
during 2022-24 in comparison with 2015-17, despite a similar level of challenge in the 
domestic production front, as is evident from Chart V.11 below:

5.16.		 In the food basket, the prices of protein-rich food items such as eggs, meat and 
fish had declined for some months, but recovered soon in the later months (Chart V. 
12). Inflation in milk products, however, remained stable at around 2.6 per cent.

5.17.		 Unlike the previous year, horticultural commodities did not witness a surge in 
inflation during the current year; instead, their prices declined sharply. The contraction 
was particularly pronounced for potatoes, onions, tomatoes, and garlic, with price fall 
ranging between 20 and 40 per cent (Chart V.13), while deflation in other vegetables 
was more moderate. Owing to seasonality in production and arrivals, their perishable 
nature, and susceptibility to weather shocks, prices of these commodities tend to be 
highly volatile. Given the central role of TOP commodities (tomatoes, onions and 
potatoes) in the consumption basket of Indian households, the Government actively 
intervenes to contain excessive price fluctuations through buffer stocking and market 
release operations. In 2025–26, onion buffer stocks were released from September

2025 through direct retail sales to consumers at discounted prices, as well as supplies 
to mandis and wholesale markets in major consumption centres. Additionally, the use 
of rail transport for onion movement—initiated in 2024–25—was further scaled up in 
2025–26 to ensure more cost-effective and efficient market intervention.

5.18.	 Amid the sharp disinflation observed across several food items, the experience 
of edible oils stands out. The edible oil market in India is characterised by structural 
excess demand, with over 50 per cent of domestic consumption met through imports, 
rendering domestic prices highly sensitive to global price movements, exchange 
rate fluctuations, and trade policy changes. In response to sharply falling prices, the 
Government imposed a basic customs duty (BCD) of 20 per cent on crude edible oils 
in September 2024, which helped support domestic prices. Subsequently, with prices 
rising again in FY26, the duty was reduced to 10 per cent in June 2025 to alleviate 
upward price pressures. The impact of this reduction is evident, as the pace of edible oil 
inflation has moderated since August 2025 (Chart V. 14).

Agricultural activity creates a benign environment for inflation
5.19.		 The agricultural outlook in FY26 has been broadly favourable for inflation 
outcomes. The precipitation levels were generally supportive, with about 30 states/UTs 
recording normal or excess rainfall. Cereal production reached a record high of about 
3,320 lakh tonnes in 2024–25, supported by strong yields in rice, wheat, and coarse 
cereals. For 2025–26, the first advance estimates—covering only the kharif season 
so far—place cereal output at around 1,659 lakh tonnes. Pulses production recorded 
modest gains in 2024–25, reaching approximately 257 lakh tonnes, although variability 
across individual crops persisted. Oilseeds registered a sharp increase, with output of 
the nine major oilseeds rising to around 430 lakh tonnes in 2024–25, led by soybean, 
groundnut, and rapeseed–mustard.
5.20.	 Rabi sowing in the current year exceeded last year’s levels, with total cropped 
area expanding by 3.3 per cent year-on-year (as of 16 Jan 2026), supported by improved 
reservoir storage and soil moisture conditions. Pulses’ acreage increased (3.8 per cent), 
led by expansion in the area under gram cultivation. Oilseeds sowing rose by 3.5 per 
cent, driven by an expansion in rapeseed/mustard and safflower, which is expected 
to support edible oil availability, even as groundnut and sesamum acreage declined. 
Overall, the foodgrain area increased by 3.0 per cent, indicating a good Rabi season and 
strengthened food security.

(ii) housing, (iii) health and (iv) transport and communication – account for nearly 
one-third of the CPI basket and more than 60 per cent of the core measure. The price 
movements in these components, therefore, play an important role in shaping the 
behaviour of core inflation. Over the past two years, inflation has been gradually easing 
in three of the four components, while fluctuating in the fourth. Since Q2 of FY26, signs 
of disinflation appeared in these components other than housing (Chart V.15). 
5.22.	 Housing inflation declined steadily through 2023 and early 2024 and thereafter 
stayed stable. This pattern reflects the nature of rental and housing-related prices, 
which are typically revised infrequently (often annually) and are influenced by 
negotiated agreements rather than spot market conditions. Health inflation shows a 
similar profile, with a gradual easing from higher levels in 2023 to lower and more 
stable levels thereafter. Prices in this category may be shaped by service delivery costs, 
administered fees, and institutional pricing practices, which tend to adjust slowly over 
time. As a result, these categories contribute stability to the core basket. Further, since 
July 2025, it has been experiencing moderation.

5. 23.	 Inflation in ‘clothing and footwear’ fell sharply from elevated levels in early 
2023 to lower levels by 2024-25. This disinflation reflects easing input costs, improved 
supply conditions and competitive pressures in goods markets where prices adjust 
more frequently. Unlike housing and health, prices in this category respond relatively 
quickly to changes in costs and demand, allowing inflation to decline when pressures 
abate. Transport and communication inflation, by contrast, remains lower on average 
but exhibits episodic movements. These short-lived fluctuations are driven by specific 
sub-components, such as fares, fuel-linked services, and changes in telecom pricing. 
However, since June 2025, disinflationary trends have appeared in the transport and 
communication component.  
GDP DEFLATORS: MANUFACTURING’S REVERSAL IN 
TERMS OF TRADE
5.24.	 The GDP deflator is a broad measure of general price level in an economy. It is 
defined as the ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP. Unlike CPI or WPI, it reflects economy-
wide price movements, including in services and changes in the composition of output, 

Economic Survey 2025-26

making it a comprehensive indicator that can be used to understand inflationary or 
deflationary pressures in the economy. 
5.25.	Following the logic of GDP deflators, one could find the implicit price deflator 
for a sector as the ratio of its Nominal or Current price GVA to Real or Constant price 
GVA. It’s essentially a price index for that sector, pivoting around the base year with a 
value of 1 as the current and constant price values remain the same for the base year 
in a data series. The ratio of manufacturing to agriculture sector deflators tells how 
manufacturing prices have moved relative to agricultural prices. If the ratio is greater 
than 1, then Manufacturing prices are higher relative to agricultural prices, which 
implies better terms of trade for manufacturing and vice versa.

5.26.	 It is observed that the agricultural GDP deflator has grown faster than the other 
sectors (Chart V.16). By FY25, it is at 2.17 relative to the 2011–12 base year. The GDP 
deflators of Industry and Manufacturing rose at a slower pace — 1.55 for industry and 
1.41 for manufacturing by FY25, while that of services was better off at 1.75. 
5.27.	 Accordingly, the terms of trade for the manufacturing sector with respect to 
the agriculture sector, i.e., the ratio of the Manufacturing Deflator to the Agricultural 
Deflator, starts high (~1.29 in FY05) and steadily declines by 50 per cent to 0.65 in FY25, 
while its ratio with the service sector deflator declines by 25 per cent to 0.81 by FY25. 
Unlike agriculture, where prices may have risen due to the prevalence of government 
support, which sees an annual guaranteed price increase, or services, which enjoy more

pricing power, manufacturing is usually characterised by global competition, cost-
cutting technologies, and narrower margins, which might be accounting for this decline 
in terms of trade.2
5.28.	 This declining terms of trade also translates as lower share of manufacturing 
in the GVA in current price terms, which has seen a decline from 17-18 per cent two 
decades ago to around 14 per cent in FY25, while its share in GVA in constant price 
terms and share in Gross Value of Output (GVO) have remained fairly constant at 18 
per cent and 38 per cent, respectively. 
5.29.	 Better terms of trade in favour of agriculture might encourage resource shift 
towards agriculture, i.e., more land put to agricultural use, labour going back to 
agriculture, the evidence of both of which is visible in the Indian economy. On the 
other hand, declining relative prices for manufacturing mean that the sector might 
face tighter margins as input costs (especially those from agriculture) rise, and this 
could deter investment if it is prolonged. However, profit margins of India Inc have 
not shown any signs of stress, indicating the adoption of other cost-cutting or labour-
saving innovations to preserve competitiveness. This also underscores the requirements 
for “Farm-to-Fork” policies that streamline the supply chain from producers to 
consumers—emphasising freshness, local sourcing, and fewer intermediaries, thereby 
reducing overall cost in the economy.
INFLATION: REGIONAL PICTURE
Rural vs Urban Inflation 
5.30.	 Throughout much of 2023 and 2024, rural inflation remained above urban 
inflation (Chart V. 17). This pattern reflects differences in consumption weights across 
rural and urban baskets, particularly the larger share of food items in rural consumption, 
which renders rural inflation more responsive to movements in food prices. Elevated 
inflation during 2023 and mid-2024 coincides with food price pressures, during which 
the rural-urban gap widened. As food inflation eased in 2025, inflation declined across 
both sectors, with inflation in the rural sector going below that in the urban sector. 
As food prices are more volatile, rural inflation across the states has shown greater 
volatility than inflation in urban areas.

5.31.	In contrast to headline inflation, core inflation in rural and urban areas follows 
a smoother and more gradual adjustment path, declining steadily through 2023 and 
early 2024 before stabilising within a relatively narrow range thereafter (Chart V. 18). 
Rural core inflation remains marginally higher than urban core inflation, but the gap 
is modest and stable, indicating broadly similar pricing behaviour and demand pattern 
across regions once volatile food and fuel components are excluded.

STATE-LEVEL DYNAMICS
5.32.	 The state-level incidence of inflation in 2025-26 (April-December) followed the 
national trend, with an across-the-board reduction in inflation, except in Kerala and 
Lakshadweep, where retail inflation breached the upper tolerance band of 6 per cent. In 
the rest of the states, average inflation remained within the 2-6 per cent tolerance band 
of the Reserve Bank of India, or below that (Table V. 1). Overall, the clustering of State-
level inflation outcomes within the tolerance band suggests increasing synchronisation

movements rather than broad-based inflationary persistence.

5.33.	 Using monthly State-wise CPI inflation data from January 2014 to December 
2025, Chart V. 19 examines how inflation outcomes across states compare with the 
All-India average and whether such differences tend to persist over time, i.e., whether 
some states consistently have higher or lower inflation than the national average. 
The horizontal axis shows the average difference between a State’s inflation rate and 
the national average, called as mean gap inflation3, while the vertical axis captures 
the persistence of these differences, indicating whether inflation gaps tended to fade 
quickly or carry over into subsequent months. 
5.34.	 The chart suggests that inflation differentials across States were not purely 
transitory. All States exhibited positive persistence, implying that deviations from the 
national average often extended beyond a single month.4 Far-end States in the South and 
Northeast tended to have recorded inflation above the national average, with relatively 
higher persistence. States such as Delhi and Himachal Pradesh, on the other hand, 
were typically below the national average, with comparable persistence. Several States 
clustered close to the national average, though with differing degrees of persistence.

5.35.	Overall, the pattern suggests that while national factors remain central in shaping 
inflation outcomes, State-level inflation dynamics display heterogeneity over time.  An 
3 	 For any state, the inflation differential is calculated as difference between the mean state inflation and mean 
national inflation. This is also referred as ‘mean gap inflation’.
4 	 Mathematically, for each State s, the inflation differential ds,t is modelled as: ds,t = αs + ρs ds,t–1+ εs,t where ds,t is 
the inflation differential for State s in month t, αs is a State-specific constant, ρs is the Auto Regressive [AR(1)] 
coefficient which indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between the current value of a series and 
its immediate past value, representing the "memory" or persistence of the series, and εs,t is error term. A value 
of ρs closer to 1 implies that deviations adjust gradually and tend to persist over time. A lower value of ρs implies 
that deviations diminish more quickly. A positive value of ρs indicates that deviations tend to move in the same 
direction across consecutive periods.

examination of inflation and wage rates at the state-level over a decade indicates that 
the states with an average wage rate above the national wage (i.e. positive mean wage 
gap) tend to experience a relatively higher inflation (i.e. a positive mean gap inflation)
(Chart V. 20). A recent study has also highlighted the significance of wage rates in 
increasing inflation disparity across the states.5 Our further analysis demonstrated that 
the state-level inflation rates show a significant positive association with wage rates, 
state-level GDP growth rates and COVID impact (indicating inflation increases with the 
increase in wage rate and GSDP growth rate, and that COVID had a structural step-up 
influence on the price situation). However, the share of industrial output showed some 
negative association with the state-level inflation, reflecting the benign effect of supply-
side efficiencies in manufacturing sector in dampening price pressures. GST imposition 
was found to be price neutral for state-level inflation differential. Variables such as 
weighted average lending rate, fiscal deficit ratio and credit intensity do not exhibit 
a robust independent association with inflation once state-specific and year-specific 
effects are accounted for in the 10-year duration. The share of agricultural output, did 
not seem to have a meaningful impact at the local level for the 10-year duration under 
study as production structures may be oriented more to national and export markets 
rather than flooding the local markets.6 While the present results highlight important 
associations, they should be viewed as indicative rather than definitive, and need more 
comprehensive study incorporating a broader set of explanatory factors and their 
dynamics.

6 	 We estimated the following state level fixed effects panel regression model for the period 2014-15 to 2024-25, 
controlling for unobserved State-specific heterogeneity and common year effects. The model is πit=αi+βXit+δ1GST_
post+δ2covid+uit, where πit is state-level inflation and Xit represents the vector of other independent variables such 
as, log of wage rate, weighted average lending rate, log of state-level GSPD, state’s fiscal deficit ratio, share 
of agricultural output in state GVA, share of industrial output in state GVA, credit-deposit ratio in that state. 
Dummy variables were given for the Covid-19 years of 2020 & 2021 (δ2covid) and post-GST implementation period 
(δ1GST_post) starting from 2018.  While the wage rate and state-level GSDP growth were significant at less than 1 
per cent level, the Covid dummy and share of industrial output were significant at less than 5 per cent and 10 per 
cent levels respectively. The standard errors were clustered at the State level.

OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
5.36.	 To conclude, the RBI and IMF have projected a progressive increase in headline 
inflation in the upcoming fiscal, bringing the levels within the targeted range of 4 per 
cent (± 2 per cent). In December 2025, the RBI revised its inflation projections for 
FY26 from 2.6 per cent to 2.0 per cent, owing to a good kharif harvest and healthy rabi 
sowing. IMF has projected an inflation rate of 2.8 per cent in FY26 and 4.0 per cent in 
FY27. The RBI’s forecast for headline Inflation for Q1 and Q2 of FY27 currently stands 
at 3.9 and 4 per cent. 
5.37.	 The below-normal temperature experienced through most of the months in 
2025 coupled with above-normal monsoon, which augmented reservoir levels, has 
favorably influenced kharif harvests, created strong sowing momentum in the ongoing 
Rabi season and improved the stock position of foodgrains.7 These factors are likely 
to keep food inflation at moderate levels in the upcoming months. Furthermore, 
the government's efforts to increase fertiliser supply may help keep input prices in 
agriculture in check, thereby containing inflationary pressures in the food basket. The 
continued pass-through of GST rate rationalisation into commodity prices may also 
temper inflationary pressures on the cost side. The depreciation of the currency could 
pave the way for imported inflation. However, global commodity prices are expected 
to remain soft, thereby limiting the impact. According to the World Bank’s Commodity 
Prices Outlook, October 2025, global commodity prices are expected to decline by 
approximately 7 per cent in FY27, primarily driven by subdued crude oil prices amid

oversupply. Geopolitics may come in the way of this prediction, however. On the other 
hand, the prices of base metals, such as iron, copper, and aluminium, are expected 
to increase moderately. For instance, in copper, both demand pressures (especially 
given its usage for green technology and data centres) and supply disruptions might 
keep its price elevated. The prices of precious metals, both gold and silver, are likely 
to continue increasing due to their sustained demand as safe-haven investments amid 
global uncertainties, unless a durable peace is established and trade wars are resolved. 
Some commentators feel that the torrid pace set by gold and silver in 2025 may not be 
sustained. If they are correct, core inflation excluding precious metals may be higher, 
not lower. In conclusion, India’s inflation rate – headline and core excluding precious 
metals – will likely be higher in FY27 than in FY26.  However, we believe it is unlikely 
to be a concern.
