AGRICULTURE AND FOOD 
MANAGEMENT: RAISING 
PRODUCTIVITY, SECURING 
INCOMES AND ENSURING 
FOOD SECURITY
India’s agriculture sector has shown robust growth in recent years.  Given the 
large proportion of the population supported by the sector and its crucial role 
in food security, sustained agricultural growth is imperative for strengthening 
economic resilience, promoting rural prosperity, and ensuring food security. 
Government initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana 
(PMKSY), Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), Agriculture Infrastructure 
Fund (AIF), and Kisan Credit Cards (KCC), have helped enhance agricultural 
productivity, encourage crop diversification and increase farm incomes. 
Additionally, the buoyant growth of allied sectors has positively contributed to 
agricultural performance.  
While there have been notable advancements in Indian agriculture, challenges 
that impact productivity and incomes still need to be fully addressed. Fragmented 
landholdings, inadequate marketing and storage infrastructure, limited access 
to quality inputs, relatively low levels of investment, and uneven quality of 
extension services are among the prominent reasons for the low productivity 
level. These factors collectively affect resilience and farmers' incomes. Certain 
measures aimed at enhancing fertiliser use among farmers, such as the urea 
subsidy, have led to increased application. This increased usage has been 
reported to impact soil productivity negatively. 
This chapter examines these constraints while highlighting the policy measures 
and institutional interventions undertaken by the government to support 
farmers, enhance productivity, and strengthen market linkages. It also reviews 
key welfare schemes and income-support mechanisms designed to reduce risk 
and provide support.
Additionally, the chapter examines India’s food management system, 
encompassing procurement, storage, and public distribution, to evaluate 
how food security objectives are achieved. It discusses the functioning of food 
procurement and distribution mechanisms to ensure stable supplies, provide 
price support for farmers, and ensure affordable access to foodgrains for 
consumers.

INTRODUCTION
6.1	 Agriculture and allied activities contribute nearly one-fifth of India’s national 
income at current prices, but account for 46.1 per cent1 of the country’s workforce. 
Given the relatively large share of employment in agriculture and allied activities, the 
sector remains central to India’s overall growth trajectory. Strengthening agricultural 
performance is therefore important for inclusive growth and ensuring food security. 
6.2	 Indian agriculture has demonstrated resilience, registering steady growth with 
major growth coming from the allied sector. While food grain production has increased 
in recent years, higher-value allied sectors, such as livestock, fisheries, and horticulture, 
are assuming an increasingly important role in enhancing income opportunities and 
strengthening rural livelihoods.2 At the same time, certain challenges persist, including 
fragmented landholdings, limited access to irrigation and quality inputs, low levels of 
mechanisation and investment, and stagnating yields across several crops and regions, 
which continue to limit productivity gains and farmer incomes. 
6.3	 The government is undertaking several interventions to improve productivity in 
agriculture and allied sectors through a mix of policy measures, including programmes 
for technology, input and income support, strengthening infrastructure and 
improvements in market linkages. Policy measures such as Krishonnati Yojana(KY) 
which is an umbrella scheme of 08 schemes-Mission for Integrated Development 
of Horticulture (MIDH), National Food Security and Nutrition Mission, (NFSNM), 
Sub-Mission on Agriculture Extension (SAME), Integrated Scheme on Agricultural, 
Marketing, Digital Agriculture Mission (DAM), National Mission on Edible Oil – Oilseed 
(NMEO-OS), National Mission on Edible Oil – Oilpalm (NMEO-OP) and Mission 
Organic Value, Chain Development for North East Region (MOVCDNER) which aim 
to promote the holistic, science-based development of agriculture and allied sectors to 
enhance production, productivity, and value realisation of farm produce.3 Measures to 
improve diversification, and sustainability have also positively impacted productivity. 
In addition, the decision in 2018–19 to fix the MSP at 1.5 times the all-India weighted 
average cost of production is an important step that provides greater price certainty 
and assures farmers of a specified return. 
6.4	 Income support through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), 
promotion of efficient input use and sustainable production practices through Per 
Drop More Crop (PDMC), encouragement towards the use of alternative and organic 
fertilisers, promotion of Farmer Producer Organisation (FPOs), Primary Agricultural

insurance support.  The chapter then discusses the performance of the cooperative 
sector and discusses the interventions and achievements in sustainable agriculture in 
sections 8 and 9, respectively. Sections 10 and 11 review the Food Processing Industries 
and India’s food management framework respectively including procurement, storage, 
and public distribution. Section 12 concludes the chapter with recommendations. 
OVERVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL AND ALLIED SECTOR 
PERFORMANCE
6.6	 Over the last five years, the average annual growth rate in the agriculture and 
allied sector has been around 4.4 per cent4 at constant prices. In Q2 of FY 2025-26, the 
agriculture sector registered a growth of 3.5 per cent.5 The decadal growth of 4.45 per 
cent (FY16-FY25), the highest in comparison to previous decades, has primarily resulted 
from the strong performance in livestock (7.1 per cent) and fishing and aquaculture 
(8.8 per cent), followed by the crop sector at 3.5 per cent.6

6.7	 It is important to note that during FY 15 and FY24 the livestock sector recorded 
a strong expansion, with its GVA increasing by nearly 195 per cent, registering a 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.77 per cent at current prices.7 The fisheries 
sector has also performed well, with fish production increasing by more than 140 per 
cent (by 88.14 lakh tons) during 2014-2025, compared to the increase from 2004-14.8 
Thus, allied sectors are increasingly emerging as important growth engines and key 
contributors to enhancing farm incomes. 
6.8	 India’s foodgrains production has witnessed a steady increase, despite certain 
challenges. India’s foodgrain production is estimated to have reached 3,577.3 lakh 
metric tonnes (LMT) in Agriculture Year (AY) 2024–25, an increase of 254.3 LMT over 
the previous year. This growth has been driven by higher output of rice, wheat, maize 
and coarse cereals (Shree Anna).

6.9	 The increase in production is attributed to the favourable monsoon across regions 
and the government's supportive policies. While food grain production has continued 
to expand, the horticulture sector, which accounts for approximately 33 per cent of 
agricultural GVA, has emerged as a bright spot in the country's agricultural growth 
trajectory. In 2024-25, horticulture production reached 362.08 MT, surpassing 
the estimated food grain production of 329.68 MT.9 This underscores a gradual 
diversification of agricultural output towards high-value crops. As of August 2025,

horticulture production increased from 280.70 million tonnes in 2013–14 to 367.72 
million tonnes in 2024–25 (second advance estimates).10 This expansion has been 
broad-based, comprising 114.51 million tonnes of fruits, 219.67 million tonnes of 
vegetables, and 33.54 million tonnes from other horticultural crops, highlighting the 
sector’s growing contribution to agricultural output and value.11 In addition, the country 
is the world’s largest producer of dry onions, contributing nearly 25 per cent of global 
output. India also ranks second worldwide in the production of vegetables, fruits, and 
potatoes, accounting for around 12-13 per cent of global output in each category.12 These 
achievements underscore India’s strong presence in horticulture, its growing role in 
meeting global food demand, and the opportunities in high-value crop production. 
Productivity Trends: India in Global and Domestic Perspective
6.10		 While the average annual growth rate (AAGR) in agriculture and allied activities 
has shown improvement, exceeding the global average of 2.9 per cent13 over the same 
period, there remains substantial potential to enhance agricultural productivity. Yields 
across several crops, including cereals, maize, soybeans, and pulses, continue to trail 
global averages.

of groundnut production in agro-climatically suitable semi-arid regions and a few 
high-performing states. The adoption of improved varieties, the presence of two crop 
cycles in some areas, and sustained policy focus on oilseeds, particularly in Gujarat, 
Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, have together contributed to notable productivity gains.15 
In the case of soyabean, productivity is constrained by the predominance of rainfed 
cultivation, with yields in many districts below 2 tonnes per hectare.16
6.12	A report by the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP)17 which 
compared yields per hectare across kharif crops over time and across states, found 
that many major rice-producing states such as West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, 
Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu had yield18  per hectare lower than the national 
average. The report identifies that the major causes were unseasonal rains, heat stress, 
and dry spells during critical crop stages.

6.13	In the case of pulse, yields per hectare in India across states remained low due 
to persistent technological, structural, and climatic constraints, with the latter being 
a significant driver of low and unstable yields. According to a National Institution

1951–2024), pulse acreage declined by 2-9 per cent20, production fell by 6 to 30 per 
cent, and yields dropped by 5 to 25 per cent year on year.21 In contrast, during La Niña 
conditions, both acreage and production have22 increased, along with productivity.23 
Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Gujarat are the top producers of pulses and also have 
higher yield24 than other states, largely due to the agro-climatic conditions well-suited 
to major pulse crops. MP’s black soils are particularly conducive to rotations based on 
gram, lentil, and soybeans, offering good moisture retention and nutrient availability. 
Gujarat’s semi-arid regions support short-duration pulse varieties, which perform well 
under controlled moisture stress. This alignment between crop choice and natural 
resource endowment stabilises yields. In addition, Gujarat has one of the highest Seed 
Replacement Rates (SRR) in pulses, supported by a strong cooperative and private seed 
ecosystem.25 This underscores the importance of using certified, high-performance 
varieties in place of farm-saved seeds to unlock higher yields, disease resistance, and 
productivity gains. In Telangana, the cultivated area, which stood at 1.31 crore acres 
in 2014, increased to 2.2 crore acres by FY 23 due to major flagship projects, such as 
the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project26  and Mission Kakatiya27 (tank rejuvenation), 
undertaken by Telangana.  Therefore, access to irrigation facilities, aligning crops with 
natural resource endowments, and using climate-resilient high-yielding variety seeds, 
among other interventions, are imperative for improving yields.28  
Box VI.1:  State level Innovations in Agricultural Governance 
leading to outcomes: Some evidence…
Several Indian states have undertaken targeted agricultural reforms in recent years, 
encompassing land governance, markets, water management, technology adoption, and 
crop diversification. These initiatives have improved farm outcomes. Certain key initiatives 
undertaken by various states and outcomes of the governance and scheme-based initiatives 
are as follows:

DRIVERS OF PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT: POLICY AND 
INSTITUTIONAL INTERVENTIONS. 
6.14		 The growth in the agricultural sector can be achieved through either area 
expansion or increased productivity. Given that land and water resources are 
increasingly constrained, yield improvements have become central to enhancing output 
and farm incomes. In recent years, in line with the Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) 
Report 2016, the government has been implementing a wide range of measures to raise 
productivity and enhance farmers’ incomes. The DFI report had emphasised the need to 
improve crop and livestock yields, increase cropping intensity, and promote high-value 
agriculture. Reflecting these priorities, several interventions have been undertaken 
through inputs, technology, income support, market-related and insurance support. 
Many of these priorities are being implemented through a mission-mode approach, as 
discussed in the subsequent paragraphs.
6.15	 	 The government has been implementing the National Food Security Mission 
(NFSM) since 2007 to enhance productivity and production of Rice, Wheat, Pulses, 
Coarse Cereals (maize and barley), Commercial Crops (Cotton, jute, and sugarcane), and 
Nutri-Cereals (Shree Anna), across the country through area expansion and productivity 
enhancement.42 In FY25, the scheme was renamed the National Food Security and 
Nutrition Mission (NFSNM). Demonstration of crop protection technologies, access to 
high-yielding varieties, integrated nutrient and pest management techniques, efficient 
water-saving devices, and capacity building for farmers are prominent elements of the 
mission. The National Mission on Edible Oils-Oilseeds (NMEO-OS) and the National 
Mission on Edible Oils–Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) are also being implemented to achieve 
self-sufficiency in oilseed production, aiming for nearly 70 million tonnes by 2030-31 
through productivity enhancement, improved varieties, good agricultural practices, 
private sector participation, cluster-based interventions, and assured procurement.43 
Additionally, the schemes aim to reduce import dependence substantially. Together, 
NMEO-OS and NMEO-OP represent a coordinated policy effort to enhance domestic 
supply, stabilise farmer incomes, and advance the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat in edible 
oils. To reduce import dependency on pulses by increasing productivity, the scheme 
'Mission for Atmanirbharta in pulses', aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in pulses, was 
approved on October 1 2025. 
6.16		 These combined interventions have led to a significant expansion in oilseed 
and palm oil cultivation and production. Between 2014–15 and 2024–25, the area 
under oilseeds increased by over 18 per cent, production by nearly 55 per cent, and 
productivity by about 31 per cent.44 Oil palm area more than doubled over the same

period, accompanied by sharp increases in Fresh Fruit Bunch and crude palm oil 
production. As a result, domestic edible oil availability has risen from 86.30 lakh tonnes 
in 2015-16 to 121.75 lakh tonnes in 2023-24.45 This has lowered the share of imported 
edible oil, reducing it from 63.2 per cent in 2015-16 to 56.25 per cent in 2023-2446, 
despite increasing domestic demand and consumption.  
Box VI.2: Ethanol Pricing and Cropping Incentives: 
Emerging Trade-offs for Food Security
India’s ethanol-blended fuels have become an important pillar of the nation’s energy 
security strategy in recent years. The programme has delivered tangible gains in crude oil 
substitution, reduced foreign exchange outflows, reduced emissons, and increased payments 
to farmers. As of August 2025, ethanol blending has saved India more than ₹1.44 lakh crore 
in foreign exchange and facilitated the substitution of about 245 lakh metric tonnes of 
crude oil.47 As blending targets rise towards E20, the programme has necessarily expanded 
beyond traditional sugar-based feedstock to include food grains, particularly maize. While 
this diversification has enabled rapid scaling, recent evidence suggests that administered 
ethanol pricing, interacting with underlying technological changes in maize cultivation, is 
increasingly reshaping agricultural incentives, with implications for crop diversity and food 
security. 
Maize’s recent expansion in India reflects both structural productivity and evolving market 
signals. Data show that the national maize yield increased from approximately 2.56 tonnes 
per hectare in FY16 to roughly 3.78 tonnes per hectare by FY25.48 Over the same period, 
yields for crops such as soybeans, sunflower seeds, rapeseed, peanuts, and millet, among 
others, have either stagnated or declined. This trend is consistent with broader projections 
by the OECD-FAO49, which attributes global cereal yield growth largely to technological 
improvements such as improved seed varieties and optimised agronomic practices. These 
productivity gains make maize a naturally attractive crop for farmers relative to many other 
cereals and pulses, even in the absence of policy intervention. 
However, recent patterns indicate that ethanol pricing has begun to reinforce and accelerate 
this shift. The government annually fixes administered per-litre ethanol prices differentiated 
by feedstock, with assured offtake by Oil Marketing Companies. This is intended to provide 
farmers with a steady source of income that fairly accounts for their efforts. A feature of the 
pricing structure is that the administered price of ethanol is differentiated by feedstock, with 
a higher price for maize-based ethanol, a lower price for rice-based ethanol, and a price for 
molasses-based ethanol between the two. Between FY22 and FY25, the administered price 
of maize-based ethanol increased at a CAGR of 11.7 per cent, growing materially faster than 
ethanol derived from rice or molasses. This has created a strong and persistent price signal

in favour of maize. It was hoped that this would help shift acreage from paddy to maize, with 
the former witnessing excess stocks and the latter being less water-intensive. 
Agricultural outcomes over the same period reflect a rational response to these incentives. 
Maize has recorded rapid growth in both production and cultivated area between FY22 and 
FY25, growing at a CAGR of 8.77 per cent and 6.68 per cent, respectively. During the same 
period, pulses have experienced a decline in output and acreage, while both oilseeds and 
cereals, excluding maize, have shown modest growth. The area cultivated for oilseeds grew 
at a CAGR of 1.7 per cent over the last four fiscal years, and cereals excluding maize recorded 
a CAGR of 2.9 per cent over the same time. Shifts in cultivation patterns are particularly 
visible in states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka50,51, where maize increasingly competes 
directly with pulses, oilseeds, soyabean, millets, and cotton for land, water, and labour. The 
expected reduction in paddy acreage has not materialised. 
From a food security perspective, the implications are non-trivial. Pulses and oilseeds are 
structurally important to India’s consumption basket and nutritional outcomes, yet they are 
shifting lower down the priority order for the nation’s cultivators. Over time, this imbalance 
risks entrenching India’s dependence on edible oil imports and exposing domestic food 
prices to greater volatility during supply shocks. This highlights an emerging tension 
between Aatmanirbharta in energy and Aatmanirbharta in food. 
International experience underscores the importance of caution. OECD-FAO analyses of 
biofuel programmes in major economies show that biofuel mandates and feedstock-specific 
price incentives can lead to long-term alterations to cropping patterns and food price 
dynamics when not periodically recalibrated.52 Countries with mature biofuel regimes have 
increasingly relied on adjustment mechanisms, feedstock caps, or a shift towards second-
generation biofuels to mitigate competition with food crops. The Indian experience now 
displays similar early warning signals.
The policy challenge, therefore, is the concentration and durability of incentives that may 
unintentionally favour one set of crops over others. As the ethanol programme matures, 
there is a strong case for developing a comprehensive roadmap that takes a holistic view 
of energy security and food security. Key elements of such a roadmap could include 
accelerating yield improvements in pulses and oilseeds to restore their relative profitability, 
avoiding distortions in input and output markets that confer an undue advantage to 
specific feedstocks, and enabling targeted, planned growth of ethanol feedstocks aligned 
with regional resource endowments. Such an approach would preserve the economic logic 
of ethanol expansion while ensuring that energy security objectives are pursued without 
unintentionally weakening food security or nutritional outcomes.

others. MIDH has played a significant role in expanding horticultural cultivation, 
bringing an additional 15.66 lakh hectares under horticulture crops as of July 2025.53 
The scheme has emphasised critical interventions such as the supply of quality planting 
material and the promotion of micro-irrigation. These measures have contributed to 
productivity gains, with average horticulture productivity increasing from 12.10 metric 
tonnes per hectare in 2019–20 to 12.56 metric tonnes per hectare in 2024–25.54 This 
shift towards horticulture is further reinforced by region-specific success stories across 
states, ranging from banana cultivation in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu to horticultural 
diversification in the North-Eastern and hill states, highlighting the sector’s role in 
promoting income diversification, nutritional security and more resilient agricultural 
growth.
6.18		 Agricultural productivity is the most vital differentiator in a country with limited 
capacity to enhance its agricultural land, given the competing needs of the economy and 
a fairly low per capita availability of farmland. Productivity enhancements are a factor 
of in situ and post-harvest interventions. In addition to the mission mode approach 
discussed earlier, specific interventions for each element that improve productivity are 
further deliberated.
Improving productivity in the Agriculture and allied sectors: The 
Role of Critical Inputs and Technology. 
Quality Seeds 
6.19		 Several initiatives have been undertaken to enhance productivity through input 
and technology support. A key factor limiting crop productivity is the limited availability 
of quality seeds. The Sub-Mission on Seeds and Planting Materials (SMSP), launched in 
2014–15, aims to ensure farmers have access to high-quality seeds by promoting seed 
production, processing, storage, and certification nationwide. Under this initiative, 
6.85 lakh Seed Villages were created, 1649.26 lakh quintals of quality seeds were 
produced, and 2.85 crore farmers benefited.55 A National Mission on High-Yielding 
Seeds has been announced in the Union Budget 2025-26, aimed at strengthening the 
research ecosystem, targeting the development and propagation of climate-resilient 
high-yielding varieties, and improving the commercial availability of more than 100 
new seed varieties.56
6.20		 While government initiatives have made notable progress in improving seed 
availability and varietal replacement rates, progress remains uneven across States and 
crops. In addition, many farmers continue to rely on older popular varieties or farm-

saved seeds due to high costs or limited access to certified seeds. Greater efforts are 
needed to accelerate the integration of newer varieties and to encourage farmers to 
adopt quality seeds through field demonstrations and the dissemination of successful 
farmer experiences. A way forward towards better implementation could be through the 
involvement of strengthened extension services and by integrating Farmer-Producer 
Organisations (FPOs), Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) and Self Help 
Groups (SHGs) into the implementation framework. 
Box VI.3: Prime Minister Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana: Envisioning Prosperity
The Government of India, in its Union Budget for 2025, announced the development of 100 
Aspirational Agricultural Districts under “PM Dhan Dhaanya Krishi Yojana (PM-DDKY).57” 
PMMDKY was approved in July 2025 for six-years commencing with FY26, to cover 100 
aspirational districts.  The Scheme aims to (1) enhance agricultural productivity, (2) increase 
adoption of crop diversification and sustainable agricultural practices, (3) augment post-
harvest storage at the panchayat and block levels, (4) improve irrigation facilities, and (5) 
facilitate availability of long-term and short-term credit. The districts have been identified 
based on three key indicators: low productivity, low cropping intensity, and limited credit 
disbursement.
The Scheme will be implemented through the convergence of 36 existing schemes across 11 
Departments, other State schemes and local partnerships with the private sector. Central 
Agricultural University (CAU)/State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) have been assigned as 
the technical knowledge partner for all aspects of agriculture in each district. The goal is for 
these 100 districts to surpass the national and state averages in key performance indicators, 
thereby improving national indicators and increasing farmers' incomes.
Irrigation and Water-Use Efficiency
6.21		 Access to assured water through irrigation is a key driver of agricultural 
productivity. Effective irrigation systems provide farmers with the certainty of water 
when needed, improve nutrient uptake, make agriculture more resilient to the vagaries 
of nature, facilitate crop diversification, and enable multiple cropping. The main 
goal58 of PMKSY is to achieve coordinated investments in irrigation at the farm level, 
increase the area suitable for assured irrigation, enhance efficiency in on-farm water 
usage to minimize water waste, promote the use of precision irrigation and other water-
saving techniques, boost the replenishment of aquifers, and implement sustainable 
water conservation methods by examining the viability of reusing treated municipal 
wastewater for peri-urban agriculture, all while attracting more private investment in 
precision irrigation systems. In addition, the government promotes micro-irrigation 
by providing 55 per cent financial assistance to small and marginal farmers and 45 
per cent to other farmers for the installation of Drip and Sprinkler systems under the

PDMC59 program. As a result, the gross irrigated area as a share of the gross cropped 
area has increased from 41.7 per cent in 2001-02 to 55.8 per cent in 2022-23. However, 
significant inter-State and inter-crop disparities persist, with irrigation coverage 
ranging from less than 15 per cent in millets and around 26 per cent in pulses to about 
67 per cent in rice.60 Expanding irrigation in lagging States and crops, while ensuring 
sustainability, is an urgent and important priority. The return on investment for the 
economy in rejuvenating water bodies and increasing surface water storage will be 
much greater than the returns from other public investments.61
Soil Health and Balanced Nutrient Management
6.22		 Declining soil health, particularly a decline in soil organic carbon, poses a 
major challenge to agricultural productivity in India. The Government has taken steps 
to address this through the Soil Health Management (SHM) and Soil Health Card 
(SHC) schemes62 under the National Project on Management of Soil Health & Fertility, 
promoting integrated nutrient management by combining chemical fertilisers with 
organic manures and bio-fertilisers.  Over 25.55 crore cards have been issued (as of 
14 November 2025).63 Complementing these efforts, the government also initiated 
the National Soil Mapping Programme (NSMP)64 and the National One Soil Unified 
Information System (NOSUIS)65 to generate detailed village-level soil resource 
inventories for sustainable agriculture and crop planning. The Soil and Land Use Survey 
of India (SLUSI)66 has surveyed approximately 39 million hectares and produced digital 
soil maps for 18 million hectares, providing evidence-based support for soil and nutrient 
management. Despite the scale-up of soil testing infrastructure and Soil Health Cards, 
fertiliser use remains inefficient, with the N:P: K ratio deteriorating in recent years, 
largely due to price distortions favouring nitrogenous fertilisers, leading to a declining 
crop response. Addressing this requires renewed efforts to promote balanced nutrient 
application based on soil diagnostics and analysis.
Box VI.4: Re-orienting Fertiliser Use Towards Soil Health and Crop Productivity
For more than three decades, Indian agriculture has been grappling with a steadily worsening 
imbalance in the use of plant nutrients. While high-yielding varieties and assured irrigation 
initially made heavy nitrogen application profitable, continued divergence between nitrogen 
and other nutrients has now begun to undermine soil quality, crop response and

environmental stability. Successive Economic Surveys have highlighted this problem, as the 
ratio of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) used by Indian farmers has drifted 
far from agronomic norms.
In 2009–10, the N:P:K ratio stood at 4:3.2:167, close to recommended levels for most Indian 
soils. By 2019–20 it had deteriorated to 7:2.8:1, and by 2023–24 had worsened further 
to about 10.9:4.1:1.68 Agronomic benchmarks for most crops and soil types suggest a ratio 
closer to 4:2:1.69 The divergence has been driven overwhelmingly by excessive nitrogen 
application, primarily through urea, which has become the dominant nutrient source across 
much of the country.
The consequences are now well documented. Excess nitrogen reduces soil organic matter, 
accelerates micronutrient depletion, weakens soil structure and increases nitrate leaching 
into groundwater. Over time, crops require progressively larger quantities of fertiliser to 
maintain yields, raising input intensity without commensurate output gains. In several 
irrigated belts, the yield response to fertiliser has plateaued or declined, even as application 
rates have increased. This pattern reflects not the under-use of inputs but their misallocation 
across nutrients.
India has already undertaken important steps to improve fertiliser management. Nutrient-
based pricing, neem-coating of urea, Aadhaar-linked point-of-sale verification70, and the 
Integrated Fertiliser Management System have improved transparency71, logistics and 
control over physical flows. Yet these measures operate largely on the supply and distribution 
side. They do not alter the core economic signal that farmers face when choosing nutrients. 
As long as one nutrient is vastly cheaper than others, its overuse is structurally embedded, 
regardless of monitoring or enforcement.
A more durable correction, therefore, requires re-anchoring fertiliser decisions in soil and 
crop requirements rather than in administered price distortions. This can be achieved by 
separating farmer income support from fertiliser purchase and allowing nutrient prices to 
convey agronomic scarcity.
From Input Distortion to Acre-Based Support
A practical approach is to modestly increase the retail price of urea while transferring an 
equivalent amount directly to cultivators on a per-acre basis. Farmers receive the same 
overall purchasing power, but the relative price of nitrogen moves closer to its agronomic cost.
This changes behaviour in a predictable way. Farmers who already apply nitrogen efficiently 
gain because they receive the full transfer while spending less at the counter. Farmers 
who over-apply face a clear incentive to shift towards balanced fertilisation, soil testing, 
nano-urea, liquid fertilisers and organic amendments. Low-input farmers, particularly 
those growing pulses and oilseeds in rain-fed regions, experience a net income gain. The 
adjustment is therefore both progressive and efficiency-enhancing.

Because fertiliser needs vary sharply by crop, soil and irrigation, the transfer must be 
indexed to agro-climatic zones and cropping patterns. Rice–wheat belts, sugarcane tracts 
and other high-yield systems legitimately use more nitrogen than rain-fed coarse cereals or 
pulses. Zone- and crop-specific benchmarks ensure that structural differences in agronomic 
demand are recognised while still rewarding efficiency within each category.
Soil, Water and Yield Effects
The primary benefit of this transition is agronomic. When nitrogen is no longer artificially 
cheap, farmers begin to substitute towards phosphorus, potassium and organic matter, 
restoring nutrient balance. Soil carbon levels improve, microbial activity increases, and root 
systems develop more effectively. Water retention and heat-stress resilience imporve, which 
is increasingly important under climate variability.
Corrected nutrient ratios also raise yield response. Balanced fertilisation improves nutrient 
uptake efficiency, meaning that each kilogram of applied fertiliser produces more output. 
Over time, this reduces the total quantity of fertiliser required per tonne of grain, lowering 
pressure on soils and water bodies while sustaining or increasing production.
Domestic experience with neem-coated urea, which reduced diversion and misuse, already 
shows that small changes in input design can generate large efficiency gains. Extending 
this logic to price signals completes the transition from administrative control to biological 
optimisation.
System Readiness
India’s digital agriculture infrastructure makes such a reform operationally feasible. 
Aadhaar-linked fertiliser sales at the point of purchase, combined with real-time tracking 
through iFMS, provide a detailed map of nutrient use across districts and seasons. PM-
Kisan offers a ready platform for calibrated, timely per-acre transfers. Aligning transfers 
with planting seasons ensures that liquidity reaches farmers before fertiliser is purchased.
One design issue concerns tenancy: as a portion of the land is cultivated by renters while 
transfers may accrue to owners. Over time, this is expected to adjust through the rental 
market, but pilot designs can incorporate tenancy-heavy districts to refine mechanisms 
before a wider rollout.
A Phased Agronomic Transition
Rolling out this approach across a limited number of agro-climatic regions—covering 
irrigated, rain-fed and mixed systems—would allow for careful calibration of crop- and 
zone-specific benchmarks. Data from these pilots would inform refinements to transfer 
levels, soil response and nutrient shifts before national expansion. 

Agriculture and Food Managmement

The objective is not to compress fertiliser use but to re-align it with crop physiology and soil 
biology. By restoring balanced nutrition, India can move from volume-driven input use to 
efficiency-driven crop growth.
In this way, re-engineering fertiliser support becomes a tool for protecting soils, raising 
yield response and stabilising farm incomes over the long run. It enables farmers to become 
stewards of land productivity rather than passive recipients of distorted input incentives 
placing Indian agriculture on a more resilient and sustainable trajectory.
Credit
6.23		 Access to institutional credit boosts agricultural productivity by enabling 
investment in quality inputs, mechanisation, irrigation, improved technologies, and 
climate-resilient practices, particularly for small and marginal farmers. Agricultural 
credit flows from both formal sources, such as commercial banks, Regional rural banks 
(RRBs), cooperatives, small finance banks, and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs), 
and informal sources, including moneylenders, traders, and personal networks. Key 
frameworks, such as the Lead Bank Scheme72 and Priority Sector Lending73, aim to 
ensure timely and targeted credit delivery to priority farm households and the rural 
economy. 
6.24		 Ground Level Credit (GLC) disbursement stood at ₹28.69 lakh crore, which 
includes ₹15.93 lakh crore under short term loans and ₹12.77 lakh crore under term 
loans, surpassing the ₹27.5 lakh crore target in FY 25.74 The KCC scheme, which had 
7.72 crore operative accounts with outstanding balances of ₹10.20 lakh crore as of 31st 
March 2025, was further strengthened by the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme 
(MISS), which offered loans at a subsidised interest rate of 7 per cent with a 3 per 
cent prompt repayment incentive. Between FY15 and FY26, a total of ₹ 1.77 lakh crore 
was disbursed as a subsidy under MISS.75 To streamline claim processing, the Kisan 
Rin Portal (KRP)76 was launched in 2023 and integrates 30 Scheduled Commercial 
Banks, 42 Regional Rural Banks, 20 State Cooperative Banks, and 356 District Central 
Cooperative Banks, covering over 5 crore farmers.  The portal enhances credit system 
efficiency by identifying multiple loan accounts under a single farmer, preventing misuse 
and ensuring subsidies are granted for productive loans. It has flagged ₹1,080.88 crores 
in duplicate or excess claims out of a total of ₹37,506.53 crores, thereby strengthening 
financial discipline in agricultural credit. In addition, sustained policy measures over 
the years have reduced the share of non-institutional credit from 90 per cent in 1950 to 
23.4 per cent in 2021-22.77

only 14.7 per cent of MISS benefits released79, indicating significant untapped potential 
for credit linkage and KCC coverage. Regional disparities persist, with some States 
receiving disproportionately higher credit per hectare, highlighting the need for more 
equitable distribution.
Mechanisation and Collective Access
6.26		 The Government has made significant efforts to promote farm mechanisation 
through the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM)80, providing 
assistance to State Governments for training and demonstration of agricultural 
machinery, establishing Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), and supporting farmers in 
procuring farm equipment. Between 2014-15 and 2025-26, a total of 25,689 CHCs 
have been established under the scheme, including 558 CHCs set up during 2025-

26 (as of 30 October 2025).81 However, fragmented landholdings and rising labour 
shortages continue to hinder the adoption of mechanisation,  underscoring the need for 
appropriate, affordable machinery, supported by R&D, and for strengthening collective 
ownership models through FPOs, PACS, and SHGs to enhance access and utilisation of 
mechanisation at the farm level.82 
Technology and Input Support in Livestock, Fisheries and 
Aquaculture
6.27		 Within the livestock sector, growth has been supported by measures that include 
indigenous technological capabilities to accelerate genetic improvement, reduce costs 
for farmers, and enhance herd quality. In addition, significant progress has been made 
in strengthening animal health systems. The nationwide Foot and Mouth Disease 
(FMD) control programme83, supported by central funding, large-scale vaccination, 
digital animal identification, and disease surveillance, represents a major step towards 
improving livestock productivity. About 125 crore FMD vaccinations have been 
administered since 2020. The Artificial Insemination (AI) programme has expanded, 
with annual inseminations rising from 76.23 million in 2017–18 to 88.32 million in 
2024–25, enabling 126 districts to achieve 50 per cent AI coverage and increasing AI 
coverage of breedable bovine females from 25 per cent to 40 per cent. 
6.28		 Despite recent gains, sustaining dairy sector growth remains challenging. Feed 
and fodder shortages, which account for a significant share of milk production costs, are 
the most critical constraint, as livestock growth has outpaced fodder expansion, thereby 
increasing input costs. This is because the area under fodder crops is estimated at 9.13 
million hectares, accounting for about 4.61 per cent of the gross cropped area.84 Feed 
and fodder account for over 70 per cent85 of the cost of milk production, and persistent 
shortages and quality constraints continue to affect livestock nutrition. ICAR-Indian 
Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi (IGFRI), estimates indicate demand-
supply gaps of 11–32 per cent in green fodder, 23 per cent in dry fodder, and 28–40 per 
cent in concentrates, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to ensure feed 
and fodder security. 
6.29		 Financial and technological interventions in the fisheries sector are being 
implemented under Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY)86 
introduced in February 2024. Further, the government has designated specific Nucleus

Breeding Centres (NBCs)87 to enhance the genetic quality of aquaculture species, aiming 
to improve productivity and quality of species such as shrimp, which are vital for both 
domestic consumption and export. 
Infrastructure and Marketing support 
6.30		 Recognising the need to crowd in private investment for agricultural marketing, 
the Government has implemented the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI)88 
sub-scheme under the Integrated Scheme for Agricultural Marketing (ISAM) since 2014. 
The scheme, designed as a capital investment, demand-driven, credit-linked, back-
ended subsidy programme, provides financial support to individuals, farmers, FPOs, 
cooperatives, agri-preneurs, and state agencies for creating storage and other marketing 
infrastructure. As of 31 December 2025, 49,796 storage projects have been sanctioned 
with ₹4,832.70 crore released, while 25,009 other marketing infrastructure projects 
received ₹2,193.16 crore in subsidy. To further strengthen farm-gate infrastructure 
and engage private players, the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) was launched 
with a financing facility of ₹1 lakh crore (FY 21 to FY 26, support extending to FY33), 
offering medium-term debt for post-harvest management and community farming 
projects with interest subvention and credit guarantees. As of 27 November 2025 AIF 
has mobilised ₹1,23,002 crore, supporting over 39,000 customer hiring centres, over 
25,000 processing units, over 17,000 warehouses, over 4000 sorting and grading units, 
and over 2700 cold storage projects among others.89 
6.31		 To improve price discovery and competitive access to buyers, the Government 
launched e-NAM in April 2016 as a pan-India virtual market platform. Under the 
scheme, each Agriculture Price Marketing Committee (APMC) mandi receives ₹75 lakh 
for hardware and software support, quality assaying, and related infrastructure. By 31 
December 2025, e-NAM registered around 1.79 crore farmers, 2.72 lakh crore traders, 
and 4,698 FPOs, covering 1,522 mandis across 23 states and 4 UTs. To strengthen 
collective marketing, the Government launched a new FPO scheme in 2020 with a budget 
of ₹6,860 crore through 2027-28, aiming to form 10,000 FPOs. By 31 December 2025, 
10,000 FPOs were registered. In addition, the Government has approved the Digital 
Agriculture Mission in September 2024, which envisages the creation of a Digital Public 
Infrastructure (DPI) for agriculture, including AgriStack, the Krishi Decision Support 
System, a comprehensive soil fertility and profile map, and other IT initiatives of the 
Central and State Governments to enable a robust digital agriculture ecosystem. This 
is expected to catalyse reliable, farmer-centric digital innovations and ensure timely 
access to crop-related information for farmers.90

6.32		 In the livestock sector, the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund 
(AHIDF)91 has been established to enhance value addition, minimise post-production 
losses, and strengthen market linkages. This initiative has spurred investments in dairy 
processing, animal feed manufacturing, breed improvement, and related activities, 
especially in relatively underserved regions.
6.33		 Turning to the fisheries sector, India has consolidated its status as a major global 
seafood supplier, exporting to over 130 countries. This achievement reflects increased 
productivity, diversification, and the adoption of modern practices. Government initiatives 
have played a vital role in driving this growth. Key programs, such as the Pradhan Mantri 
Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY)92, the Fisheries Infrastructure Development Fund 
(FIDF)93, and PM Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah Yojana (PM-MKSSY), have significantly 
bolstered infrastructure, improved market access, and strengthened institutional capacity. 
Investments have been funnelled into fishing harbours, fish landing centres, cold chain 
systems, processing facilities, deep-sea fishing, and advanced aquaculture systems. It can 
be seen that PM-MKSSY has advanced the formalisation of the fisheries sector through 
performance-linked incentives, supported by the National Fisheries Digital Platform, which 
has onboarded over 28 lakh stakeholders to enable digital identity, credit access, insurance 
and value-chain integration. In addition, collectivisation efforts continue through the 
formation of 2,195 Farmers Fisheries Producers Organisations (FFPOs) with an investment 
of ₹544 crore to enhance market linkages and financial inclusion.94 Financial inclusion and 
welfare programmes have extended KCC benefits to 4.39 lakh fishers, providing insurance 
coverage to 3.3 million beneficiaries, and delivering livelihood support to an average of 
7.44 lakh fisher families during lean periods.95 In addition, the ISRO-enabled Vessel 
Communication and Support System (VCS) was launched in 2024, covering over 36,000 
fishing vessels against a target of one lakh, improving safety and access to advisories.96
6.34		 Despite these gains, several challenges remain. Value addition and processing 
capacity need to expand faster to reduce dependence on a narrow export basket. 
Infrastructure gaps persist in post-harvest handling, cold chains, and logistics, 
particularly in inland and remote regions. Strengthening aquatic animal health, 
biosecurity, and quality standards will be critical as production intensifies.

improved technologies, and sustainable agriculture practices to farmers, thereby 
enhancing productivity and resilience. In India, extension services—delivered through 
public agencies, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, agricultural universities, private firms, 
and digital platforms—have historically supported major gains but continue to face 
challenges of limited reach, staff shortages, and fragmented delivery. The Government is 
implementing the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Extension (SMAE) under the Krishonnati 
Yojana to strengthen agricultural extension services. Through Support to State Extension 
Programmes Agricultural Technology Management Agency  (ATMA)97, the government 
provides farmers access to the latest technologies through training, demonstrations, 
exposure visits, farm schools, and Kisan Melas. In 2024‑25, 39.04 lakh farmers benefited, 
and in 2025‑26 (till October) 20.08 lakh farmers have been supported. 
6.36		 In addition, the Diploma in Agricultural Extension Services for Input Dealers 
(DAESI) programme trains input dealers over a 48-week course to link their businesses 
with extension services, reaching 12,920 dealers in 2024-25 and 107,659 as of October 
2025. Recent reforms focus on strengthening digital advisories, improving coordination 
across institutions, and promoting farmer-led organisations such as FPOs. These efforts 
aim to modernise extension, enhance responsiveness, and better integrate farmers into 
evolving value chains. Kisan Call Centres address farmers’ queries in 22 languages. 
30.65 lakh calls were answered in 2024-25, and 18.91 lakh till October 2025. 
PRICE AND INCOME SUPPORT
6.37		 Price and Income support policies are essential because farm incomes remain 
unstable due to weather shocks, market volatility, and rising input costs. Small and 
marginal farmers have limited resilience and weak bargaining power. Assured income 
and fair prices provide basic stability, encourage productive investment, and help 
sustain viable agricultural livelihoods. To ensure remunerative prices for farmers, the 
government announces Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for 22 mandated crops.98 The 
Union Budget for 2018-19 announced the predetermined principle of keeping the MSP 
at 1.5 times the cost of production. Accordingly, the Government has increased the 
MSPs for all mandated Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of at least 
50 per cent over the all-India weighted average cost of production. The government has 
announced the increase in MSP for all mandated Kharif and Rabi crops for the Kharif 
Marketing Season (KMS) 2025-26 and for the Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2026-27, 
respectively.

the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), has further contributed to 
strengthening farm incomes, sustaining investments and growth in the agricultural 
sector. Since its inception, under PM-KISAN, more than ₹4.09 lakh crore has been 
released to eligible farmers in 21 instalments.99 To enhance social security for vulnerable 
farmers, the Government implements the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojana 
(PMKMY), which has 24.92 lakh farmers enrolled as of 31 December 2025.100

Box VI.5: Using Procurement Efficiencies to Support 
Crop Diversification and Farmer Incomes
India’s public foodgrain procurement system has been a cornerstone of national food 
security and farmer welfare for more than five decades. It has ensured price stability, 
protected producers from market volatility, and maintained adequate stocks for the Public 
Distribution System (PDS). In recent years, however, the scale of procurement particularly 
in rice and wheat—has grown faster than underlying food security requirements, leading to 
persistently high buffer stocks and rising carrying costs. Expenditure on storage, handling, 
interest and stock rotation now absorbs a large volume of public resources that could 
potentially be used more productively within agriculture itself.
At the same time, India remains structurally dependent on imports of edible oils, pulses and 
some feedstocks. This creates an opportunity to better align farm support with changing 
consumption patterns, environmental sustainability and national self-reliance, while fully 
preserving the food security architecture.

A calibrated diversification approach
Rather than altering MSP or weakening procurement, a calibrated strategy may use savings 
from improved stock management to support voluntary crop diversification. Farmers can be 
offered financially attractive alternatives to a part of their rice and wheat acreage, particularly
in regions where procurement volumes are high but farm profitability remains modest and 
agro-ecological conditions favour other crops.
The initial phase of such an approach can focus on the eastern and central regions of 
the country, where rainfall patterns, soil conditions, and market access make crops such 
as pulses, oilseeds, and maize economically and agronomically viable. Regions that are 
strategically critical for national food security can be incorporated in later phases, once the 
approach has been tested and refined.
Linking agronomy, markets and national priorities
Crop choices under diversification would be guided by agro-climatic suitability and emerging 
market demand. In large parts of eastern India, maize, pulses, and oilseeds naturally fit 
into existing cropping systems. In central regions, oilseeds, such as gram and soybeans, are 
well suited to prevailing rainfall and soil conditions. These crops directly support national 
priorities: edible oils and pulses reduce import dependence, while maize and oilseeds 
contribute to the expansion of ethanol, livestock, and bioenergy value chains.
By encouraging such shifts on a voluntary and incentivised basis, the agricultural system can 
remain fully food-secure while becoming more diversified, resource-efficient and market-
oriented.
Ensuring farmer income protection
To ensure that diversification does not expose farmers to income risk, per-quintal or per-
acre incentives can be used to offset yield differences and transitional costs. Experience from 
several states shows that relatively modest bonuses can make alternative crops financially 
more attractive than continued monocropping of rice or wheat, particularly when combined 
with lower input costs for water, fertiliser and energy.
These incentives can be financed from the fiscal savings created by reducing the accumulation 
of excess stocks and associated carrying costs, making the overall approach fiscally neutral 
while remaining farmer-centric.
Centre–State partnership
State-level diversification missions would be implemented through a structured partnership 
between the Centre and the States. The Centre’s contribution would come from procurement, 
storage, and interest savings, while the States would fund their share from complementary 
gains, such as reduced input subsidies and existing incentive frameworks for sustainable 
agriculture. Where needed, transitional financing could be provided, conditional on verified 
acreage shifts and subsidy savings.

From procurement to market development
Over time, public intervention can gradually evolve from physical procurement towards 
enabling markets for a wider range of crops. Instead of accumulating new surpluses, the 
government can increasingly rely on price-deficiency payments, bonuses and assured 
offtake mechanisms to stabilise farmer incomes while encouraging private investment in 
processing, storage and logistics.
A portion of the fiscal savings should be reinvested in post-harvest and value-chain 
infrastructure—such as oilseed processing, pulse milling, maize drying and ethanol linkages—
leveraging public–private partnerships and the Agri-Infrastructure Fund. Research 
institutions and agricultural universities can support the transition by providing region-
specific seed and agronomic packages as part of an integrated diversification framework.
Safeguards and governance
Food security remains protected through automatic adjustments in procurement volumes 
and buffer norms. WTO compatibility can be maintained by structuring diversification 
support as area-based, decoupled payments linked to sustainability and diversification goals. 
Phased implementation ensures that price stability, stock adequacy and farmer welfare are 
continuously monitored before wider expansion.
Conclusion
Utilising efficiencies in the existing procurement system to finance voluntary, agronomy-
led diversification provides a practical pathway to increase farmer incomes, alleviate fiscal 
pressures, and enhance long-term food and nutritional security. The approach preserves the 
core strengths of India’s foodgrain system while adapting it to a more diverse, resilient and 
market-oriented agricultural future.
Crop Insurance Support
6.39		 Agriculture is highly exposed101 to weather-related and other production risks, 
making farm incomes uncertain. Insurance helps de-risk agriculture by providing 
financial protection against crop losses, stabilising farmer incomes, and enabling them 
to recover quickly and continue investing in productive activities. 
6.40		 The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) provides farmers with essential 
protection against crop losses resulting from natural calamities, pests, diseases, and 
adverse weather conditions throughout the crop cycle. In 2024‑25, the scheme insured 
4.19 crore farmers, a 32 per cent increase over 2022‑23, covering 6.2 crore hectares, 
up 20 per cent from the previous year. Since its inception in 2016‑17, PMFBY has 
processed 86 crore applications and disbursed over ₹1.90 lakh crore in claims. The 
DigiClaim module ensures timely direct payments to farmers via the Public Financial 
Management System (PFMS), while the upgraded National Crop Insurance Portal

(NCIP) serves as a single source of verified information, promoting wider state adoption 
and increased farmer participation. By mitigating financial risks, the scheme enables 
farmers to invest confidently in modern inputs and technologies, thereby enhancing 
agricultural productivity.
6.41		 In addition to the above-mentioned initiatives, the government is also 
implementing the Restructured Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme.102 Operational 
improvements, including the adoption of the Yield Estimation System based on 
Technology (YES-TECH) for yield estimation, Weather Information Network and Data 
System (WINDS) for automatic weather stations, and automatic rain gauges, have 
enhanced transparency and objectivity. YES-TECH leverages remote sensing for yield 
estimation, currently implemented in nine major states, with Madhya Pradesh adopting 
a fully technology-based yield assessment. 
Cooperatives
6.42		 Cooperatives have long played a pivotal role in Indian agriculture by facilitating 
collective action in credit, input supply, and marketing, particularly for small-scale 
farmers.103 Their role is expanding with modern cooperatives and FPOs supporting 
aggregation, better price realisation, digital market access, and participation in 
processing, making them central to a more competitive and inclusive farm economy.
6.43		 Recent initiatives aim to reposition cooperatives, particularly PACS104 and 
cooperative banks, as decentralised, multipurpose institutions that support rural 
livelihoods, financial inclusion, and agricultural transformation. A key reform is the 
restructuring of PACS through model bye-laws that permit diversification into over 
25 activities, including input supply, storage, processing, fuel retail, and delivery of 
public services. This shift aims to enhance their financial viability and integrate PACS 
into rural service ecosystems. Large-scale computerisation and integration with the 
cooperative banking network are intended to enhance transparency and efficiency. A 
total of 67,930 PACS are being computerised, with ₹752.77 crore given to States and 
₹165.92 crore to NABARD.105 So far, 54,150 PACS are on Enterprise Resource Planning 
(ERP) software, and 43,658 are live. The project for 18,000 PACS was inaugurated on 
24 February 2024, boosting digital operations in cooperatives.
6.44		 The plan to establish new multipurpose PACS, dairy, and fisheries cooperatives 
across all panchayats reflects an ambition to universalise cooperative presence. 
Reflecting this, by March 2025, 18,183 new multipurpose cooperative societies had

been registered across the country.106 Complementary initiatives, such as decentralised 
grain storage through scheme convergence, position PACS as critical nodes in post-
harvest management. The decentralised grain storage program has set up godowns in 
11 PACS, with foundation stones laid for 500 more on 24 February 2024.107
6.45		 As an important initiative to strengthen the cooperative movement in India, 
Tribhuvan Sahkari University is being established.108 While initiatives such as the 
creation of a national cooperative university, the inclusion of cooperatives in school 
curricula, and the introduction of a National Cooperation Policy highlight efforts to 
revitalise the cooperative sector, the effectiveness of these measures will depend on 
improving governance and enhancing professional management.
Promoting sustainable agriculture
6.46		 Promoting sustainability in agriculture requires greater crop diversification, the 
efficient use of inputs such as water, fertilisers, and energy, and the wider adoption of 
sustainable practices, including integrated nutrient and pest management, as well as 
application of climate-resilient technologies, to protect resources and enhance long-
term productivity. The government is also implementing the Crop Diversification 
Programme (CDP) under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY)109 to demonstrate 
and promote better production technologies for alternative crops and to restore soil 
fertility through the cultivation of legumes. 
6.47		 Further, the government has been actively promoting organic and climate-
resilient farming through targeted schemes such as the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas 
Yojana (PKVY) for all States/UTs (except the North East) and the Mission Organic 
Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER).110 The promotion 
of Natural Farming (NF) through the Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati (BPKP)111 nd 
its scaled-up version, the National Mission on Natural Farming (NMNF), is also a 
significant intervention. With a budget of ₹2,481 crore, NMNF has established 17,632 
clusters covering 6.39 lakh hectares, trained 32,224 Community Resource Persons, and 
enrolled 15.79 lakh farmers.112 More than 3,500 Bio-Resource Centres and 1,800 model 
demonstration farms have been created to provide bio-inputs and hands-on training.113 
Outreach initiatives have sensitised over 28 lakh farmers, while 6 lakh114 farmers are

registered under the online Natural Farming Certification System (NFCS), enabling 
access to premium markets. Research and innovation are also being strengthened 
through Competitive Research Grants.115
6.48		 Despite these achievements, challenges remain. Organic and natural farming 
still cover a small fraction of total cultivated land. The limited availability of quality 
inputs, uneven adoption of improved practices, and gaps in extension services all 
constrain scaling.116
Food Processing
6.49		 The food processing industry is among the largest employers in India’s organised 
manufacturing sector, accounting for 12.91 per cent of total organised manufacturing 
employment.117 In FY25, India’s agri-food exports, including processed foods, totalled 
USD 49.43 billion, accounting for approximately 11.2 per cent of total exports. Within 
this, the share of processed food exports has increased steadily, rising from 14.9 per 
cent in FY18 to 20.4 per cent in FY25. 
6.50		 To support the sector’s growth, the Government of India has implemented 
several key initiatives. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) focuses 
on strengthening modern infrastructure and improving farm-to-retail supply chains 
to reduce post-harvest losses, expand processing capacity, and boost exports. As of 30 
November 2025, 1,185 projects under PMKSY had been completed. In addition, the 
Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI), launched in 2021, 
aims to build globally competitive food processing enterprises by supporting branding 
and marketing in international markets. By 31 December 2025, 169 applications had 
been approved under the scheme, with beneficiaries reporting investments of ₹9,207 
crore and incentives disbursed amounting to ₹2,162.55 crore. 
6.51		 Furthermore, to provide comprehensive support—including technical, financial, 
and business assistance for establishing or upgrading micro food processing enterprises—
the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME) 
scheme was launched in 2020. As of 31st December 2025, 4,04,062 applications have 
been sent to banks and 1,72707 loans have been sanctioned with term loan amount 
of ₹14.19 thousand crores. Seed Capital support has been sanctioned for 3,65,935 
women SHG members amounting to ₹1277.45 crore.  Additionally, the programme has 
successfully trained 693 Master Trainers, 1,312 District Level Trainers, and 1,36,723 
beneficiaries across 36 States and Union Territories.

FOOD MANAGEMENT
6.52		 The government has taken various measures in recent years to strengthen both 
food and nutrition security and price stabilisation. To ensure food management, the 
government undertakes the procurement of food grains, such as Wheat, Rice, and Coarse 
Grains, from farmers at the Mandis, manages their movement, storage in warehouses, 
and distribution through the network of Fair Price Shops (FPS). Wheat, Rice and Coarse 
Grains are distributed free of cost to the weaker sections of the population through 
the Public Distribution System (PDS), particularly women and children. Sugar and 
edible oils, too receive government attention, given their importance in Indian food. To 
stabilise prices the government undertakes measures such as the Open Market Sale of 
staple food grains. 
6.53		 The government has also taken several initiatives, including leveraging new and 
emerging technologies to ensure food supply. The reforms undertaken in recent years 
have strengthened both food and nutrition security by ensuring the distribution of 
fortified food, enabling greater inclusiveness through Aadhaar-based deduplication and 
One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) portability, expanding direct subsidy delivery 
via DBT, and leveraging cutting-edge digital platforms for enhanced transparency and 
efficiency. These measures have significantly improved the targeting of food subsidies 
towards the most vulnerable sections of society, particularly migrants, the urban poor 
and marginalised groups. 
6.54	 The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, was introduced to provide a legal 
guarantee of subsidised foodgrains to nearly 67 per cent of India's population. In 1997, 
the Targeted PDS (TPDS) replaced the universal system, focusing on the poor by dividing 
households into Below Poverty Line (BPL) and Above Poverty Line (APL) categories. 
In 2000, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) was introduced to support the poorest of 
the poor, now covering about 2.5 crore households. Under the NFSA, coverage for rural 
and urban populations is 75 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively, totalling around 
81.35 crore beneficiaries, according to 2011 Census.

6.55		 While NFSA118 provides the legal framework for subsidised foodgrain 
distribution, the Government has, from time to time, introduced additional measures 
to strengthen food security during crises. It was in this context that the Pradhan Mantri 
Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) was launched, initially as a COVID-19 relief 
measure, to provide free food grains in addition to NFSA entitlements. The scheme 
has since been continued, and under PMGKAY, foodgrains are being provided free of 
cost to all NFSA beneficiaries, fully funded by the Central Government. In addition 
to this, to improve farmers’ income, the government assist in increasing post-harvest 
lending through the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Electronic Negotiable Warehouse 
Receipt (e-NWR) based Pledge Financing (CGS-NPF). This scheme majorly focuses on 
Small and Marginal Farmers, Women, SC, ST and Divyangjan (PwD) farmers. Besides, 
MSMEs also benefited from this scheme. This scheme covers pledge loans extended on 
e-NWRs issued against agricultural and horticultural commodities, as well as the losses 
incurred by the bank due to credit and warehouseman risks.
Box VI.6: Transforming Food Subsidy Delivery through Technology, 
Targeting, and Transparency.
The government’s emphasis extends beyond food security to ensuring nutritional adequacy. 
By reducing the cost of essential staples, food subsidies increase disposable incomes among 
the covered population, enabling them to diversify their consumption basket with proteins, 
dairy, and horticulture products. In pursuit of this objective, multiple initiatives, such as 
DBT and ONORC, as well as other digital interventions, have been implemented.

ONORC has been rolled out across all 36 States/UTs, covering nearly 80 crore NFSA 
beneficiaries. In FY24, ₹267.6 crore was transferred directly through DBT to over 10 lakh 
beneficiaries in Chandigarh, Puducherry, and parts of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman 
and Diu, offering choice while reducing leakages. Aadhaar seeding was achieved for 99.8 per 
cent of ration cards119 and 98.9 per cent120 of beneficiaries, ensuring no exclusion of genuine 
poor households. Further, 99.6 per cent of 5.43 lakh Fair Price Shops (FPSs) are now 
equipped with Electronic Point of Sale (ePoS) devices linked to Aadhaar-based biometric 
authentication. Over 98 per cent of monthly foodgrain distribution is conducted through 
these digital transactions, significantly reducing leakages and diversion.
To enhance accuracy under NFSA, inter-database integration across platforms such as the 
Central Board of Direct Taxes, Goods and Services Tax Network, PM-KISAN, etc., flagged 
8.51 crore121 records for verification. Following field verification, over 2.12 crore ineligible 
beneficiaries have been removed by States/UTs, improving subsidy targeting. 
Supply chain optimisation has also been prioritised. The “Anna Chakra” tool has been 
introduced to improve logistics, enhance efficiency, and reduce carbon emissions, while 
serving 81 crore vulnerable beneficiaries. In parallel, a GPS-based Vehicle Location Tracking 
System (VLTS) is being implemented to monitor real time movement of foodgrain transport 
vehicles.  This initiative has been fully implemented in six states: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, 
Gujarat, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi. It is partially implemented in ten States/UTs, 
with rollout in the remaining States/UTs targeted for completion by March 2026. 
CONCLUSION
6.56		 Agriculture will be central to achieving Viksit Bharat, driving inclusive growth 
and improving the livelihoods of millions. India has made notable progress in increasing 
agricultural production, particularly in key sectors such as dairy, poultry, fisheries, and 
horticulture, which collectively contribute significantly to the country's GDP.122 The 
strengthening of cooperatives and the rise of farmer-producer organisations (FPOs), 
have further expanded access to credit, innovative technology, and efficient value 
chains. These entities play a vital role in empowering small and marginal farmers by 
facilitating collective bargaining and ensuring fair prices for their produce. Additionally, 
the adoption of digital technologies, such as the Digital  Agriculture Mission, and e-NAM 
which connects farmers with markets, is increasing transparency and competition.123

sustainability and productivity. Climate change poses a significant challenge, with 
erratic weather patterns, rising temperatures, and extreme events affecting crop yields. 
Water scarcity is a pressing and crticical challenge in regions that are predominantly 
dependent on monsoon rainfall. Addressing these challenges necessitates region-
specific interventions tailored to local agro-climatic conditions and natural resource 
availability. Promoting climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as drip irrigation 
and sprinkler systems, as well as diversifying to high-yield, an appropriate crop mix of 
climate resilient/drought resistant crops, is critical for sustainability.
6.58		 While investment in research and development has been a hallmark of Indian 
agriculture through a strong and robust research ecosystem,  continuity with focus on 
innovation in agricultural practices, improved seed varieties that are resistant to pests, 
diseases, and climate stresses, as well as modern farming techniques that maximise 
resource efficiency, will be key to enhancing long-term productivity. Furthermore, the 
widespread adoption of digital technologies, including precision agriculture tools and 
data analytics, can significantly optimise farming operations and yield predictions.
6.59		 Indian agriculture is entering a phase of new opportunity, supported by advances 
in irrigation, digital extension, improved storage, and the strengthening of cooperatives 
and value chains. Yet, structural challenges such as small landholdings, climate risks, 
productivity gaps, and weak market integration continue to weigh on farm incomes124. 
The way forward lies in deepening ongoing reforms, promoting climate-resilient 
technologies, empowering FPOs, strengthening cooperatives, improving markets and 
logistics, and improving risk management. 
6.60		 With sustained investment and innovation, agriculture can become more resilient, 
competitive, and income enhancing.125 Strengthening private sector participation in 
areas such as food processing, cold chain logistics, and the development of high-value 
agricultural products will be crucial to increasing competitiveness in both domestic and 
export markets.126 Expanding high-growth sectors, such as horticulture, agroforestry,
