BUILDING STRATEGIC RESILIENCE AND 
STRATEGIC INDISPENSABILITY:  
THE ROLE OF THE STATE, THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR AND THE CITIZENS
You have a right to action alone, not to the fruits of your labour.
Do not let the fruits of action be your motive, nor allow yourself to fall into inaction.
–Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 2, Verse 47 
Why is State Capacity the binding constraint today?
16.80. 	India’s economic development over the past three decades has unfolded within 
an institutional setting that is distinctive in both comparative and historical terms. It 
is a rare example of a large, diverse, low-middle-income country that has combined 
sustained growth with democratic continuity, periodic macroeconomic consolidation, 
and incremental yet cumulative policy reform. This achievement has rested not only 
on markets and entrepreneurship, but also on a State that has gradually learned to 
reconcile stability with change in a society marked by plural preferences and high 
expectations of public provision. Any discussion of state capacity must therefore begin 
from this vantage point, not of institutional failure, but of demonstrated resilience and 
adaptive competence.
16.81. 	As discussed in the first part of this chapter, India is now entering a phase of 
development qualitatively different from that experienced since the early 1990s. 
Structural economic transformation at home is unfolding against a backdrop of 
persistent and profound geopolitical reconfiguration. The global economy is shifting 
towards a more segmented form of globalisation, in which trade is increasingly organised 
around blocs, capital flows are shaped by strategic and security considerations, access 
to technology is selectively restricted, and geopolitical risk premiums are embedded in 
economic decisions.
16.82. In this setting, the demands placed on the State have not diminished; they 
have changed in character. Stability, prudence, and democratic legitimacy remain 
indispensable, but they are no longer sufficient on their own. They must now be

complemented by a greater capacity to coordinate across institutional boundaries, to act 
with confidence under conditions of uncertainty, and to change course when learning 
exposes the limits of prior assumptions. The central question is therefore no longer 
whether India has the right policies or the right institutions, but whether it possesses 
sufficient state capacity - institutional, administrative, social, and cognitive to operate 
effectively in a world that is less forgiving of disorder, indiscipline, and short-termism.
16.83. State capacity, in this chapter, is understood in the sense articulated by 
Somanathan and Natarajan (2022)1, as the ability of the government to “get the right 
things done.” It refers not merely to the availability of resources or formal authority, 
but to the institutional capability of the State to effectively design policies, implement 
them, and deliver on commitments made to citizens. State capacity, in this conception, 
spans both policymaking and execution, and rests on administrative judgement, 
technical competence, and organisational arrangements that allow the State to act 
under constraints and uncertainty. Weak development outcomes, in this view, arise 
less from a lack of ideas or intent than from deficiencies in the State’s ability to translate 
decisions into sustained and reliable action.
16.84.  In what follows, this part of the chapter advances a simple but central argument. 
India’s most consequential constraint today is no longer the absence of policy intent, 
ideas, or resources, but the incentive structures within institutions that shape how 
decisions are taken under uncertainty. This core constraint manifests across multiple 
domains: bureaucratic risk aversion, organisational design, regulatory practice, private-
sector behaviour, and citizen expectations. The sections that follow examine these 
manifestations in turn, not as independent weaknesses, but as interlinked expressions 
of the same underlying incentive problem. The chapter then examines ongoing efforts 
at deregulation and compliance reduction as a practical test of whether institutional 
alignment can be restored in practice.
Why entrepreneurial governance is hard
16.85. The first part of this chapter argued that a world of deep uncertainty requires 
a shift towards an entrepreneurial state, not to replace markets, but to act under 
uncertainty, structure risk, and learn systematically. Accepting this diagnosis, however, 
raises a more difficult question: if such a state is conceptually necessary, why has it 
proven so difficult to realise in practice? The answer lies not in intent or ambition, 
but in the institutional mechanisms through which risk, failure, and accountability are 
processed.

16.86. 	For starters, India’s difficulty lies in the fact that its institutional environment has 
evolved in ways that place an asymmetric burden on visible action relative to procedural 
continuity, especially under conditions of uncertainty. Temporary measures have often 
become permanent through what might be called irreversibility creep, raising the stakes 
of any experiment. Good-faith decisions are subjected to retrospective scrutiny through 
audits, vigilance processes, and judicial review, often without adequate recognition of 
the uncertainty under which they were taken. Entrepreneurial initiatives are evaluated 
using metrics suited to routine administration, such as compliance, revenue collection, 
and procedural correctness, rather than learning, capacity creation, or long-term impact.
16.87. 	No country that has successfully navigated structural transformation attempted 
to make its entire bureaucracy entrepreneurial. Equally, it may not be possible for the 
bureaucracy to be entrepreneurial all the time, because stability and predictability too 
are necessary traits of good administration. Instead, successful states created bounded 
institutional spaces - zones where experimentation was permitted, accountability rules 
were differentiated, and learning was explicit. Japan’s sectoral desks, Korea’s planning 
agencies, and Singapore’s regulatory institutions all functioned as such safe spaces.
16.88. For India, entrepreneurial safe spaces could take several forms: mission-based 
cells focused on manufacturing, energy, logistics, or urbanisation; regulatory sandboxes 
extending beyond fintech into labour, environmental, and trade regulation; explicit 
legal protection for good-faith decisions; and independent ex-post review mechanisms 
that prioritise learning over blame. Such spaces are not exempt from accountability, 
but are legally bounded domains in which accountability recognises ex-ante and real-
time uncertainty rather than retrospective certainty. What matters is not the specific 
institutional form, but the underlying principle: experimentation must be bounded, 
reversible, and accountable in a manner appropriate to uncertainty. 
16.89. Democracy adds a layer of complexity. In democratic systems, politicians 
are often closer to lived realities and public sentiment, while bureaucracies provide 
continuity, memory, and procedural integrity. The risk, of course, is that politicians 
drift into populism while bureaucracies drift into insularity. An entrepreneurial state 
requires a more subtle division of labour. Political leadership must set direction and 
articulate priorities. Bureaucracies must discover pathways, solve problems, and adapt 
instruments. Institutions must absorb error without collapsing into either paralysis 
or permissiveness. Whether a bureaucracy is becoming entrepreneurial can only be 
assessed through its learning capacity.
16.90. Moving from diagnosis to action requires reform on several fronts. Legal and 
institutional frameworks must codify protection for good-faith decision-making and 
clearly separate error from corruption. Incentive systems must reward problem-solving 

Economic Survey 2025-26
656
656
and capacity-building rather than mere procedural compliance, and rotation policies 
must allow for continuity when learning is cumulative. Accountability mechanisms 
must shift away from hindsight-driven punishment towards context-aware review, 
while visibly penalising inertia where damage is clear. Above all, political leadership 
must send consistent signals that reversible failure is acceptable, experimentation is 
necessary, and course correction is a mark of competence rather than weakness.
16.91. A useful contrast is provided by the experience of the Republic of Korea,2   which 
illustrates how entrepreneurial state capacity was built not through bureaucratic 
boldness alone, but through carefully designed institutional sequencing. Korea’s early 
export-led industrialisation forced firms to comply with demanding foreign standards, 
initially as adopters rather than setters. This created an external discipline that 
reduced discretion while simultaneously compelling learning. Over time, the Korean 
state invested systematically in national standards bodies, metrology, and conformity 
assessment, treating them not as peripheral technical functions but as core instruments 
of industrial strategy. Crucially, these institutions operated as bounded spaces in which 
technical judgment, experimentation, and feedback from firms were encouraged, while 
accountability remained aligned to ex ante objectives rather than ex post outcomes.
16.92.The broader lesson is not one of institutional replication, but of design logic. 
Accountability mechanisms focused on whether decisions were reasonable given the 
information available at the time, rather than on whether all outcomes succeeded. 
This architecture allowed the state to act under uncertainty without paralysing fear 
of error, and to evolve from a rule-taker to a rule-shaper in global markets. For India, 
the relevance lies in the principle that entrepreneurial governance emerges when 
experimentation is disciplined, incentives are aligned to learning, and institutional 
design explicitly distinguishes good-faith error from malfeasance.
16.93. The opportunity before India is considerable. Few countries possess India’s scale, 
diversity, institutional depth, and democratic legitimacy. If these assets are combined 
with a bureaucracy that is capable of acting entrepreneurially (disciplined, reversible, 
and learning-oriented), the state can move beyond being a regulator of economic activity 
to a catalyst for structural transformation. In a world defined by uncertainty, it is not 
the most controlling states that will succeed, but those that learn fastest, adapt most 
intelligently, and retain the confidence to correct course. India has the institutional 
foundations to do so. The task now is to align mindset, incentives, and accountability 
with that possibility.

Box XVI.3: Bureaucratic Integration, the Entrepreneurial State, 
and Mobilising Culture for Scale in India
In India’s social and business life, trust tends to be strongest within families, castes, 
communities, and familiar networks, and much weaker outside them. Inside these circles, 
people rely on reputation, social pressure, and mutual support to manage risk and enforce 
good behaviour. Beyond them, transactions become more uncertain, more costly, and 
harder to scale. As a result, individuals and firms often stick to familiar networks, not out 
of preference alone but because dealing across social boundaries carries greater risk and 
higher penalties when things go wrong. In this way, culture limits how far economic activity 
can easily expand at any given moment.
Over time, state-led efforts at bureaucratic integration have eased this constraint by replacing 
personal connections with predictable rules and procedures. When authority is impersonal 
and reliable, people can transact with strangers without having to rely on trust built through 
kinship or community. After Independence, national examinations and public-sector career 
ladders produced cross-regional élites with portable credentials; land reforms in parts of 
the country weakened entrenched hierarchies; and the creation of national financial and 
regulatory institutions enabled firms to engage the state as formal entities rather than 
through local intermediaries. More recently, platforms such as Aadhaar, the Unified 
Payments Interface, GST, and digitised land and property records have reduced dependence 
on relational credit and informal verification, allowing small entrepreneurs and migrants 
to transact beyond their immediate circles. In logistics and exports, the standardisation 
of customs and port procedures has begun to weaken historically entrenched commission 
networks. Culture continues to matter, but its ability to limit cooperation beyond close 
networks is weakened.
The entrepreneurial state complements this institutional integration by coordinating 
expectations and bearing risk in sectors where fragmented private actors would otherwise 
hesitate to act. In automotive components in Tamil Nadu, pharmaceuticals in Gujarat 
and Hyderabad, and more recently electronics manufacturing clusters in Noida and 
Sriperumbudur, public policy has not only regulated but convened and aggregated: 
facilitating cluster formation, underwriting early investment, shaping procurement and 
export pathways, and making global standards attainable for small and mid-sized firms. 
In renewables, space, defence manufacturing, and select digital infrastructure, public 
institutions have signalled technological direction in advance of market consensus.
These initiatives have worked not by negating cultural repertoires but by selectively 
mobilising them. Industrial upgrading and strategic manufacturing have been framed as 
projects of national dignity, technological self-respect and upward mobility. This narrative 
function is particularly important in a low-trust environment, as it legitimises collaboration 
with unfamiliar partners, compliance with common standards, and the transition from 
informal networks to formal systems, without requiring individuals to disavow their local 
loyalties. Culture thus becomes partially endogenous to policy.
The Indian experience also underscores the limits of this endogeneity. Hierarchy, insider 
advantage and patronage frequently re-embed themselves within new institutional shells. 
Yet, where bureaucratic integration has reduced uncertainty and the entrepreneurial state

Economic Survey 2025-26
658
658
has provided visible ladders of mobility — as in segments of the automobile, pharmaceutical, 
and electronics industries — kinship-based constraints have become less binding, and 
coordination has scaled without cultural rupture.
Seen this way, state capacity is not about overriding culture but about making it less binding. 
The task is to lower the penalty for stepping outside one’s circle through fair and predictable 
institutions, and to raise the reward for doing so through credible pathways to technological 
and economic upgrading. When that occurs, elements of the same cultural repertoire, such 
as aspiration, thrift, perseverance, status ambition, and pride, can be mobilised as assets for 
development and scale rather than as barriers to them.
16.94. As the State takes on a more active coordinating role of integrating markets, 
convening actors, and shaping expectations, the nature of institutional risk also 
changes. Actions taken to reduce uncertainty and facilitate activity can gradually 
harden into expectations and routines, raising the cost of adjustment over time. For an 
entrepreneurial state, the ability to withdraw or recalibrate becomes as important as the 
ability to act. Box XVI.4 examines this issue through the lens of hysteresis and policy 
reversibility, and its implications for the exercise of state capacity under uncertainty.
Box XVI.4: Hysteresis, Policy Reversibility, and the Entrepreneurial State
In public policy, hysteresis occurs when temporary measures become permanent, when 
incentives solidify into entitlements, and when regulatory or administrative interventions 
alter expectations and political alignments in ways that render reversal costly or infeasible. 
Subsidies, protection, exemptions, and discretionary approvals are particularly prone to this 
dynamic. Once economic and political actors reorganise around such interventions, reversing 
them can trigger litigation, political backlash, and administrative disruption. Anticipating 
this, officials rationally avoid experimentation altogether, leading to institutional risk 
aversion and policy inertia.
An entrepreneurial state cannot function under such conditions. Entrepreneurship in 
governance does not mean boldness without restraint; it means acting under uncertainty 
while preserving reversibility. Avoiding hysteresis therefore requires deliberate design of 
state capacity along three dimensions: staffing, processes, and mindsets.
First, staffing structures must privilege judgement over risk avoidance. Entrepreneurial 
functions such as mission cells, regulatory sandboxes, and policy pilots require small, stable 
teams with analytical depth, legal support, and continuity of tenure, insulated from routine 
compliance and ex post policing. Thin but capable decision layers reduce the tendency to 
lock in permanent solutions merely for defensibility.
Second, reversibility must be built into administrative processes by default. Schemes should 
be designed with explicit exit options rather than assumed permanence. Sunset clauses, 
staged scaling, conditional rollouts, and mandatory post-implementation reviews should be 
routine for subsidies, exemptions, and experimental regulations. Equally important is the 
separation of learning-oriented ex-post review from blame-oriented scrutiny. Where

Building Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
659
659
oversight mechanisms assess decisions against information available at the time (rather 
than outcomes revealed later), officials retain the confidence to act. 
Third, administrative mindsets must shift from 'correctness' and adherence to precendence, 
to judgment. In high-uncertainty environments, credibility lies not in never reversing 
course, but in revising decisions transparently as evidence evolves. This requires a clear 
institutional distinction between good-faith error, design failure, implementation failure, 
and malfeasance. Without such differentiation, fear substitutes for judgement, and 
institutions learn to delay rather than decide.
Hysteresis risk is not uniform across policy domains. It is highest where benefits are 
concentrated and costs are diffuse – subsidies, protection regimes, financial forbearance, 
land and environmental permissions, and large infrastructure contracts. In such areas, 
entrepreneurial action must be especially bounded, legally disciplined, and accompanied by 
credible exit mechanisms. Political leadership plays a critical role here by absorbing some of 
the short-term costs of reversal to protect long-term administrative learning.
A state that cannot reverse cannot learn; a state that cannot learn cannot adapt. Preventing 
hysteresis is therefore not a technical refinement, but a foundational requirement of an 
entrepreneurial state.
Learning without forgiveness: Why States that punish failure lose 
the future
16.95. Policies that operate in uncharted terrain, whether in industrial strategy, financial 
regulation, technology governance, or social policy, cannot be optimised ex ante. They 
must be tested, revised, and sometimes abandoned. Yet Indian institutions treat visible 
correction as evidence of incompetence rather than maturity. 
16.96. Institutional forgiveness does not mean leniency, nor does it imply the abdication 
of accountability. It is not a tolerance of corruption or negligence. On the contrary, 
forgiveness becomes meaningful only when it is paired with a clear distinction between 
good-faith error and malfeasance. High-capacity states draw this distinction sharply. 
Low-capacity states blur it, often deliberately, until fear substitutes for judgment.
16.97. Historically, the states that escaped this trap did so by building institutional 
memory rather than institutional blame. In post-war Japan, policy failures in industrial 
targeting were common, sometimes costly. What mattered was not the failure itself, but 
whether it generated insight that informed subsequent action. The same official could 
preside over an unsuccessful sectoral bet and still advance, provided the reasoning was 
sound and the learning explicit. Career trajectories were shaped by judgement under 
uncertainty, not by the absence of error.
16.98. Authoritarian systems have achieved learning through a different route: political 
insulation rather than institutional forgiveness. Local experimentation is encouraged, 

Economic Survey 2025-26
660
660
failure tolerated, and success rapidly scaled — so long as political red lines are respected. 
This model produces speed, but at the cost of transparency and often at the risk of 
hidden fragilities. It is not transferable to a democratic, legalistic polity like India. But 
it underscores a crucial point: learning is never free; it is merely paid for differently.
16.99. For democracies, the price of learning must be paid through institutional design 
rather than political discretion. This requires a deliberate architecture of forgiveness. 
Such an architecture begins with how failure is viewed. Not every adverse outcome is 
a failure of intent or competence. Some are failures of hypotheses. Others are failures 
of timing. Still others are failures of coordination.  Equally important is the temporal 
dimension of accountability. Ex ante clarity and ex post proportionality matter more 
than real-time scrutiny. This may require an explicit re-orientation of the approach of 
agencies like the Comptroller & Auditor General and of Vigilance systems. It will also 
need an appropriate balance in laws relating to the prosecution of public servants.
16.100. For India to have the entrepreneurial state it sorely needs, honest officials must 
be protected from vexatious prosecution. Where a complex regulatory or economic 
decision is being alleged to be ill-motivated but without clear evidence of quid pro 
quo, the answer is difficult. The law will need to weigh this without making economic 
decision-making risk-averse.
16.101. In the decades ahead, India will face decisions for which there are no manuals. 
In each case, outcomes will depend less on the correctness of initial choices and more 
on the State’s capacity to learn, revise, and act with confidence under uncertainty.
Box XVI.5: The RTI Act: Transparency without Blindness
The Right To Information (RTI) Act, 2005, is widely seen as one of India’s most powerful 
democratic reforms. The RTI Act is first and foremost an anti-corruption and accountability 
instrument, and its contribution to democratic governance is beyond dispute. It empowered 
citizens to demand answers, lifted the veil of administrative secrecy, and gave ordinary 
people a tool to challenge corruption. Yet, like any powerful instrument, it carries risks. 
Unless carefully balanced, RTI risks becoming an end in itself, with disclosure celebrated 
regardless of its contribution to better governance. That may undermine the very purpose it 
was meant to serve. It must be reiterated, however, that any re-examination must preserve 
its central role as an accountability instrument, while refining its operation in narrowly 
defined areas of internal deliberation.
The idea of citizens’ right to know is not uniquely Indian. Sweden pioneered it with the 
world’s first Freedom of Information Law (FOIA) in 1766. The United States enacted 
its FOIA in 1966, and the United Kingdom followed in 2000. Interestingly, former UK 
Prime Minister Tony Blair later admitted he regretted introducing it, not because he 
opposed accountability, but because he felt governance itself suffered: “You can’t run a

Building Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
661
661
government without being able to have confidential discussions with people on issues 
of profound importance.” The UK House of Commons Justice Committee (2012–13) 
reached a similar conclusion, urging wider use of exemptions to protect candid internal 
debate. The global experience suggests that transparency works best when paired with 
room for candid discussion.
By global standards, India’s RTI Act is relatively expansive. In the United States, internal 
personnel rules, inter-agency memos, and financial regulation reports are exempt from 
disclosure. Sweden protects fiscal and monetary policy, supervisory activities, and the 
economic interests of institutions under its secrecy provisions. The United Kingdom exempts 
policy formulation where disclosure may harm the public interest, with ministers retaining 
veto powers even against orders of courts or commissions. The World Bank similarly 
excludes deliberative information and administrative matters from its disclosure policy.
India, in contrast, leaves far less space for such carve-outs. Draft notes, internal 
correspondence, and even personal records of officials often enter the public domain, 
sometimes even where the link to public interest is weak. Unlike the United States, the 
United Kingdom, or South Africa, which explicitly shield policy deliberations and draft 
documents, India has no general “deliberative process” exemption. File notings, internal 
opinions, and draft notes fall squarely within the Act’s definition of information, with only 
Cabinet papers protected temporarily until a decision is made. Combined with a strong 
public-interest override that can compel disclosure even of exempt material, this makes 
India’s RTI regime particularly broad. The challenge now is to preserve this openness while 
also retaining space for candid and effective decision-making. 
The Law of Unintended Consequences
The concern is predictable: if every draft or remark might be disclosed, officials may hold 
back, resorting instead to cautious language and fewer bold ideas. The candour needed 
for effective governance is blunted. This is not an argument for secrecy by default. Rather, 
democracy functions best when officials can deliberate freely and are then held accountable 
for the decisions they finally endorse, not for every half-formed thought expressed along the 
way.
Indian courts have already recognised these boundaries. In Girish Ramchandra Deshpande 
v. CIC (2013), the Supreme Court exempted personal records of public servants from 
disclosure. In R.K. Jain v. Union of India (2013), the Court shielded Annual Confidential 
Reports. More recently, in Canara Bank v. C.S. Shyam (2017), it reaffirmed that employee 
data cannot be disclosed unless an overriding public interest is established. These rulings 
affirm that privacy and confidentiality complement democracy rather than weaken it.
A Case for Re-Examination
Nearly two decades on, the RTI Act may need re-examination, not to dilute its spirit, but to 
align it with global best practices, incorporate evolving lessons, and keep it firmly anchored 
to its original intent. A few possible adjustments may be worth exploring. One could be to 
exempt brainstorming notes, working papers, and draft comments until they form part of 
the final record of decision-making. Another option could be to protect service records, 

Economic Survey 2025-26
662
662
transfers, and confidential staff reports from casual requests that add little value to the 
public interest. A third might be to explore a narrowly defined ministerial veto, subject 
to parliamentary oversight, to guard against disclosures that could unduly constrain 
governance. These are not prescriptions, but suggestions worth debating to ensure that the 
Act remains effective while also safeguarding the integrity of decision-making.
The RTI Act was never intended as a tool for idle curiosity, nor as a mechanism to micromanage 
government from the outside. Its purpose is far higher, and the law itself makes that clear. 
The Act seeks “to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public 
authority” and “to contain corruption and to enhance the people’s participation in the 
democratic process.”
The Act is best understood not as an end in itself, but as a means to strengthen democracy. 
The wiser path is to keep it anchored to this original aim: enabling citizens to demand 
accountability for decisions that affect them, while also ensuring that space for candid 
deliberation and respect for privacy remain protected. That balance between openness and 
candour is what will keep the RTI Act true to its purpose.
Organisational design and the burden of governance – Capacity 
depends on how responsibilities and ownership are organised.
16.102. The ability of the State to learn, correct course, and act with confidence under 
uncertainty ultimately depends on how responsibilities, authority, and ownership 
are organised within its institutions. As organisations expand in scale and their 
responsibilities become more complex, the weight placed on inherited functional 
structures tends to increase faster than their capacity to deliver outcomes. In such 
environments, challenges arise not merely from resource constraints or managerial 
effort, but also from the architecture that organises responsibilities, authority, learning, 
and execution. Traditional function-based structures serve important purposes by 
concentrating expertise and preserving professional depth, yet they often locate 
multiple, sometimes competing, roles within the same organisational boundaries. 
When regulatory, developmental, operational, supervisory, and coordination tasks 
coexist inside the same units, managerial attention is stretched, and priorities become 
blurred. At the same time, outcomes increasingly depend on collaboration across semi-
autonomous units, delivery systems, geographic footprints, and external partners. This 
disperses accountability and weakens feedback loops unless organisational design 
evolves in parallel with mission complexity.
16.103. In both public and private institutional contexts, effectiveness improves when 
structures are organised around clearly articulated missions and outcomes with 
explicit objectives and time horizons, rather than being anchored solely to permanent 
functional mandates. This is fundamentally a design challenge rather than a behavioural 
one. Capability is not strengthened by exhortation alone; it depends on whether roles 
that conflict are separated, whether mission-oriented structures are created where 

Building Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
663
663
objectives are interdependent, and whether continuity is protected in posts where 
institutional memory and learning curves make a material difference to performance. 
Ultimately, capability is tested in execution, and even sound strategies falter when 
responsibilities are fragmented and when no clearly identifiable locus of ownership 
exists for the outcomes the organisation seeks to achieve.
16.104. The question of ownership and accountability arises with particular force in 
cluster-based and mission-oriented structures. Cluster arrangements can improve 
coherence by grouping related domains around shared strategic purposes, yet they 
risk becoming merely forums for consultation if responsibility is diffused too widely. 
More robust designs distinguish between shared contribution and clearly assigned 
ownership of outcomes. In such architectures, the cluster lead assumes ownership of 
the outcome. It is responsible for defining priorities, sequencing actions, reconciling 
trade-offs, and reporting on progress. At the same time, the participating units retain 
control over their instruments and resources and operate within an outcome-anchored 
performance frame. Responsibility for actions may be distributed, but accountability 
for outcomes is located, visible, and reviewable.
16.105. The logic underpinning these arrangements has close parallels in the evolution of 
large private-sector organisations as they have grown across product lines, geographies, 
and technologies. Firms that began with strongly functional structures often found that 
functional excellence did not automatically translate into enterprise-level performance 
once they diversified or internationalised. As product portfolios widened and regional 
operations multiplied, coordination costs rose, and conflicts of priority emerged between 
specialist functions that continued to optimise for their own domains. In response, 
many organisations shifted toward divisional, business-unit, or matrix designs that 
retained functional expertise. At the same time, product, market, or regional leadership 
was added to oversee end-to-end outcomes. In such systems, business-unit or regional 
heads assumed ownership of results for their domains, while cross-cutting missions 
such as digital transformation, operational resilience, or sustainability transition were 
sponsored at the senior executive level and implemented through dedicated, mission-
oriented structures that cut across functions and territories.
16.106. These private-sector trajectories highlight design lessons that resonate in public 
and quasi-public systems. First, as organisations become multi-mandate or multi-
domain systems, purely functional structures struggle to manage interdependence 
because they lack a natural locus for integrating objectives and brokered trade-offs. 
Second, coordination mechanisms are effective only when coupled with recognisable 
centres of outcome ownership that possess the authority and informational vantage 
point required to align contributors toward a shared objective. In both sectors, the 
challenge is not simply to coordinate activities, but to ensure that coordination is 

Economic Survey 2025-26
664
664
embedded within an accountability architecture that makes outcome responsibility 
visible and actionable.
16.107. Public-sector organisations often face an additional layer of complexity because 
policy, regulatory, and implementation responsibilities coexist with inter-organisational 
and inter-jurisdictional collaboration. Cluster and mission-oriented approaches can 
play a role here by providing institutional stability, domain depth, and continuity on 
the one hand, and direction, prioritisation, and outcome focus on the other. The central 
coordinating entity functions most effectively when it acts as an enabling and integrative 
platform that aligns incentives, resolves conflicts across missions, strengthens 
monitoring and learning, and prevents both excessive centralisation and unproductive 
diffusion of authority, rather than as a substitute for specialised structures.
16.108. In both public and private contexts, therefore, mature organisational design 
entails a dynamic balance between functional depth, mission or cluster alignment, and 
explicit outcome ownership. Functional structures preserve expertise and professional 
capabilities, while mission-oriented or clustered arrangements align related mandates 
around shared purposes. Clearly identified outcome owners ensure that results have a 
clearly accountable centre of gravity. When these elements are aligned, organisational 
performance becomes less dependent on informal coordination or individual effort 
and more grounded in institutional capability, learning, and intent. By progressively 
aligning structures with the goals they are intended to serve, organisations operating 
in complex environments are better able to adapt to interdependence while preserving 
clarity of purpose and integrity of execution.
16.109. In India’s federal structure, States pursue capacity building and policy objectives 
through different institutional arrangements, reflecting differences in history, 
administrative capacity, and development priorities. What is common across States, 
however, is a growing recognition of the importance of organisational design and clear 
outcome ownership in delivering results. These initiatives, in their different forms, are 
all means directed towards the larger end of strengthening state capacity.
16.110. The State Support Mission of NITI Aayog represents one such example of how 
these principles are being put into practice to strengthen cooperative federalism and 
state capacity. (Box XVI.6).

Cooperative Federalism through State Support Mission
The State Support Mission (SSM) of NITI Aayog is a flagship initiative of NITI Aayog to 
operationalise its core mandate of strengthening cooperative federalism and advancing the 
shared national vision of Viksit Bharat@2047.

Recognising that States/UTs follow diverse pathways for development and the requirement 
for an agile, forward-looking institutional framework to steer the scale of transformation 
required, the SSM focuses on institutional strengthening, capacity building, fostering 
innovation, promoting cross-state learning, dissemination of best practices, and leveraging 
knowledge institutions to support evidence-based policymaking and strategic development 
planning.
A central pillar of the Mission is the establishment of State Institutions for Transformation 
(SITs), envisioned as State-level think tanks that provide continuity in long-term visioning, 
strategic reforms, evidence-based policymaking, and enhance implementation capacity. 
States and UTs are encouraged to either establish dedicated SITs or reimagine and strengthen 
existing Planning Departments/Boards/Commissions to perform these functions. 
As of date, 32 States and UTs have established SITs. These include, among others, the Gujarat 
State Institution for Transformation (GRIT), Maharashtra Institution for Transformation 
(MITRA), State Institute for Empowering and Transforming Uttarakhand (SETU Aayog) 
and the Tripura Institution for Transformation (TIFT). Further, 26 States and UTs have 
also partnered with Knowledge Institutions (LKIs) such as IITs, IIMs, and leading Central 
and State Universities, by leveraging the technical, analytical, and sectoral expertise of these 
institutions to support State-led reforms.
The Mission has encouraged States and UTs to articulate long-term development visions, 
and integrate advanced analytics and domain expertise into their sectoral strategies.
The SSM has also supported States and UTs in strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation 
(M&E) frameworks, addressing high-priority information needs and enabling data-
driven governance. The NITI for States (NFS) Knowledge Platform has reduced 
information asymmetry by offering a single-window repository of best practices, policies, 
datasets, and knowledge products to inform decision-making.
Overall, the State Support Mission is empowering every State and UT to evolve into a 
Developed State, to contribute to building a Viksit Bharat. Seen in this light, the State 
Support Mission can be viewed as an institutional effort to support state capacity.

in practice. States act through institutions, and institutions, in turn, act through 
individuals. As policy challenges become more complex, technology-driven, and 
expectation-intensive, the quality of public outcomes increasingly depends on how civil 
servants interpret roles, exercise judgment, and engage with citizens. State capability, 
in this sense, is not only a function of formal structures or procedures, but also of the 
human systems through which public authority is exercised in practice.
16.112. India’s administrative system carries the imprint of its historical origins. 
Designed initially for command, compliance, and hierarchy, it prioritised order and 
control. Over time, democratic deepening and developmental expansion extended 
this administrative architecture into domains it was not originally designed to 
serve, enabling delivery at scale but also shaping interactions between policymakers 
and citizens through procedures and rules. As a result, governance has often been 
experienced as rule-bound and impersonal, reflecting inherited structures more than 
contemporary intent. Yet in everyday life, citizens increasingly expect the State to be 
accessible, responsive, and fair.
16.113. At the same time, India is witnessing the strengthening of a participatory ethos 
through Jan Bhagidari, reflecting a shift towards governing with citizens as partners 
in public outcomes. This orientation aligns with the broader national vision of Sabka 
Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas, which emphasises partnership, 
development, trust, and collective effort, and is reinforced by ideas such as Nagrik 
Devo Bhava and Antyodaya, which place respect, empathy, and fairness at the centre 
of public service. Mission Karmayogi, implemented through the Capacity Building 
Commission, plays a critical role in shaping bureaucratic culture towards citizen-
centric service by emphasising not only what civil servants do, but how they engage 
with citizens and how feedback from these interactions informs institutional learning.3
16.114. As economies move to higher levels of development, the challenge for public 
administration is no longer only to expand capacity, but to repurpose the idea of 
service itself. Modern governance increasingly requires systems that can learn, adapt, 
and absorb change rather than merely comply with static rules. Large organisations, 
including governments, evolve more effectively when reform is treated as a process of 
absorption rather than disruption. Incremental learning, role clarity, and the gradual 
internalisation of new practices enable durable change, whereas abrupt or purely 
structural interventions often provoke resistance.4
16.115. Depth in analytical and administrative support, along with systems that enable 
coordination, analysis, and follow-through, significantly increases the likelihood of

successful execution. Strengthening state capability, therefore, involves investing in 
high-quality teams, improving the skills and continuity of supporting staff, and ensuring 
that specialised analytical and technical functions are adequately resourced alongside 
general administrative roles.
16.116. As governance challenges become more project-oriented and time-bound, 
execution also benefits from flexibility in team formation. Enabling senior officials to 
assemble teams around clearly defined objectives improves focus and accountability, 
particularly for complex initiatives. Supplementing core administrative capacity with 
young professionals and domain specialists adds analytical depth, fresh perspective, 
and speed, especially in purpose-driven and time-bound goals. Over the medium 
term, recruitment strategies and skill profiles matter for sustaining such capability, as 
administrative systems perform best when the breadth of perspective is complemented 
by functional competence.
16.117. Rapid technological change is also transforming the nature of work within 
government itself. While automation and artificial intelligence can improve efficiency, 
the future of governance increasingly depends on distinctly human capabilities, 
including judgment, ethical reasoning, collaboration, and systems thinking. Mission 
Karmayogi reflects this shift by moving away from rigid role definitions towards 
dynamic capability frameworks that align individuals with evolving functional needs. By 
embedding continuous learning, competency mapping, and domain-specific capacity 
building within the civil services, the programme recognises that effective execution in 
complex environments depends not only on technology adoption, but on how officials 
interpret responsibility, manage uncertainty, and exercise discretion in real-world 
settings.5 
16.118. A distinctive feature of Mission Karmayogi lies in its explicit grounding in values 
drawn from India’s civilisational traditions. Effective reform in the Indian context 
must combine modern administrative practices with ethical anchors that emphasise 
duty, service, and collective purpose. The mission’s guiding principles—development, 
pride in service, duty, and unity—along with personal virtues such as self-reflection, 
collaboration, and citizen-centric purpose, position public service as a vocation rather 
than a transactional role. This approach underscores an Indian pathway to reform, 
where institutional change is sustained not only through formal rules and incentives, 
but through internalised values that shape behaviour over time. In doing so, Mission 
Karmayogi seeks to strengthen state capability by aligning professional identity with 
public purpose and reinforcing trust between institutions and citizens.6

The Regulatory State as a Core Component of State Capacity
16.119. Regulation is one of the most consequential interfaces between the state and the 
economy. Regulators provide public goods in the public interest by protecting consumers, 
enabling market development, and enforcing rules. In doing so, they exercise powers—
legislative, executive, and judicial—that closely resemble those of the Government itself. 
Governance through regulators offers clear advantages: specialisation, continuity, and 
insulation from day-to-day political pressures. At the same time, it raises significant 
concerns about accountability, the concentration of authority, and procedural fairness. 
The central challenge is therefore to minimise these risks while preserving the strengths 
of the regulatory form. Given the complex agency relationships involved, the design and 
placement of regulators must be anchored within a coherent vision of public interest 
rather than treated as ad hoc institutional solutions.
16.120. In practice, regulators operate as mini-states within their domains, 
simultaneously exercising quasi-legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial powers. 
Frequently, the same individuals or internal divisions perform multiple roles such 
as lawmaker, investigator, and judge, without clear procedural separation. There is 
nothing inherently inappropriate about regulators exercising these powers, as modern, 
complex markets require strong and responsive institutions. However, when power is 
concentrated without adequate internal checks, credibility suffers.
16.121. Therefore, regulatory capacity is a question of institutional design as much as 
it is of intent or effort, spanning rule-making, enforcement, accountability, and the 
structuring of delegated authority as discussed in Box XVI.7.
Box XVI.7: Regulatory Capacity as Institutional Design
Regulatory capacity depends on how formal powers granted to regulators are structured, 
exercised, and constrained through institutional design. Some important considerations are 
discussed in the following institutional design choices:
Clarity in rulemaking and guidance 
In many regulatory systems, the volume of circulars, guidelines, and master directions 
exceeds the parent statute, creating uncertainty and diluting the authority of the parent 
regulation. When subsidiary instructions begin to substitute for regulation, the boundary 
between law and administration becomes blurred, complicating compliance. Regulatory 
frameworks should, therefore, clearly distinguish between regulations and subordinate 
guidance. Substantive rulemaking must follow transparent processes, including publication 
of draft regulations, public consultation, and disclosure of responses, and should rest with

Building Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
669
669
the governing board. Subsidiary instructions should remain confined to clarificatory and 
procedural matters, subject to internal discipline and periodic review.7
Separation within authority 
Regulators often exercise quasi-legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial powers within 
the same institution. This reflects the complexity of modern markets and is not inherently 
problematic. However, it places a premium on internal separation and discipline.  
Regulatory boards that anchor accountability 
The effectiveness of regulatory institutions depends on their governing boards that act 
as principals, holding executive management accountable while exercising independent 
judgement on policy and enforcement. Board composition plays a critical role in this 
regard. The presence of independent and part-time members brings external perspective, 
professional diversity, and detachment from day-to-day operations. This enables boards to 
shape decisions rather than merely endorse managerial outcomes. Balanced representation 
across relevant disciplines, including law, economics, and market expertise, strengthens 
deliberation and institutional oversight. Institutional independence is further supported 
through fixed tenures, eligibility criteria, safeguards against arbitrary removal, and post-
tenure restrictions.8
Proportionality and discipline in enforcement
Regulatory capacity is tested in enforcement. If sanctions are imposed without regard to 
intent, scale, duration, or harm, enforcement risks becoming checkbox compliance rather 
than advancing regulatory objectives. A robust enforcement architecture, therefore, requires 
proportionality to be embedded in institutional design. Proceedings should culminate in 
a single, reasoned determination of contravention, enabling calibrated use of penalties, 
disgorgement, remedial directions, or suspensions based on clearly articulated aggravating 
and mitigating factors. Interim measures should remain preventive, time-bound, and 
subject to safeguards.
Due process as an operational norm
As regulators exercise powers analogous to those of a civil court, procedural fairness becomes 
an essential component of regulatory capacity. Capacity is weakened when enforcement 
proceeds without full disclosure of material relied upon or when adjudicatory outcomes are 
inadequately reasoned. 
Democratic anchoring and transparency
Regulatory autonomy without democratic anchoring risks eroding trust. Regulatory capacity, 
therefore, depends not only on expertise and independence, but also on transparency and

accountability to representative institutions. Statutory publication of regulations, subsidiary 
instructions, enforcement orders, and governance decisions, along with parliamentary 
laying and periodic review, situates regulatory action within a democratic framework while 
preserving operational independence.
Delegated regulatory capacity within a principal-agent hierarchy
Modern regulatory systems operate through layered delegation rather than direct command. 
As analysed by Braun and Gilardi,9 democratic governance functions as a chain of principal-
agent relationships, beginning with citizens and extending through legislatures, the executive, 
and specialised regulatory institutions. Each step in this chain involves a transfer of authority 
accompanied by risks of agency loss, making institutional design, constraints on discretion, 
and oversight mechanisms central to regulatory capacity. Regulatory effectiveness depends 
on how delegation is bounded, monitored, and overseen. Recent statutory experience 
under the Securities Markets Code, 2025, illustrates this approach by empowering market 
infrastructure institutions as statutory actors, while subjecting delegated authority to due 
process, transparency, and parliamentary oversight.10 In this context, Chapter 3 (Box III.6) 
offers a detailed discussion of the Securities Markets Code, 2025.
Building Regulatory Capacity - School for Regulations
16.122. A significant gap persists in the availability of human resources capable of 
ensuring the efficient functioning of a market economy. While academic institutions 
have tailored traditional courses in law, economics, accounting, and management to 
address the demands of a market economy, a dedicated, comprehensive, and structured 
programme aimed at building regulatory capacity remains elusive. Consequently, 
regulators and businesses rely on professionals trained in conventional disciplines, 
often requiring extensive adaptation.
16.123. Regulators need experts capable of balancing freedom with oversight, while 
businesses require professionals who can harness this freedom to drive growth 
while adhering to regulations. With the right talent in place, regulators, businesses, 
and professional firms could better appreciate each other's perspectives, fostering 
collaboration and significantly improving the overall ease of doing business. This 
calls for an institutional arrangement that cultivates a cadre of professionals adept in 
regulatory design and implementation to improve the ease of doing business. Schools 
of Regulatory Studies could be established either as new stand-alone institutions or as 
additions to existing institutions.

Responsible Regulation
16.124. The recruitment process for full-time members of regulatory agencies 
and tribunals has predominantly drawn upon candidates with prior experience in 
government, particularly those with long tenures in public administration. At the same 
time, to build sustained expertise, regulators and regulatory tribunals should attract 
professionals at a younger age to pursue dedicated careers. Regardless of the age at which 
they join, appointees should serve until the standard retirement age for government 
service. This would ensure a steady infusion of expertise and independence, equipping 
these institutions to meet the demand.
16.125. State authorities operate through layered hierarchies, where each level can revisit 
and revise the decisions of the level below, even after implementation. Crucially, such 
revisions occur without any institutional accountability for the disruption caused. Each 
authority can afford to be wrong, repeatedly, without consequences. This asymmetry 
undermines the integrity of the resolution process. If regulated entities must act 
decisively and face the consequences of their actions, why should state authorities not 
be subject to similar standards of responsibility and finality? If business decisions can 
be made in one go, there is no reason state approvals cannot be the same.
16.126. The interests of business and the economy demand certainty in commercial 
transactions. These should, at most, require approval by a single designated authority. 
Once granted, such approval should be final. Of course, finality of approval pertains 
to transactional certainty, not to immunity from investigation, sanction, or corrective 
action where fraud, misrepresentation, environmental harm, or violation of law 
is subsequently established. This principle must form the bedrock of all economic 
regulatory frameworks. Rigorous oversight is essential to deter misconduct and hold 
wrongdoers accountable. However, such oversight must be disentangled from the 
validity of commercial transactions once they have been lawfully approved or deemed 
approved. A streamlined, single-tier approval process, coupled with institutional 
accountability for any lapses, is essential for an economy aspiring to be a developed 
country.
16.127. Most regulatory processes, including approvals, investigations, enforcement 
actions, disputes, and appeals, are driven by money. Delays, therefore, impose real 
economic costs. To address this, decisions must be subject to strict timelines, with 
provisions for deemed approvals when authorities fail to act within prescribed periods. 
Under the Competition (Amendment) Act, 2023, the Competition Commission of 
India (CCI) now operates with shorter statutory review timelines for mergers and 
combinations. The overall review period has been reduced from 210 to 150 calendar 
days, and the CCI is required to form a preliminary (prima facie) opinion within 30 
calendar days of notice. This amendment, which deems combinations approved if not 
decided within a fixed timeframe, provides a useful precedent.

Economic Survey 2025-26

16.128. Economic laws should specify timelines for every stage of regulatory action, with 
consequences for non-compliance. Just as obstructing a public servant is penalised, 
failure by authorities to deliver services within mandated timelines should be treated as 
an obstruction to economic activity. Moving from discretionary, open-ended processes 
to enforceable deadlines is essential for embedding respect for the time value of money 
within the regulatory system.
16.129. Having examined the institutional design and accountability of the regulatory 
state, it is equally necessary to examine how private economic actors respond to, and 
shape, this institutional environment.
The Private Corporate Sector and Nation-Building
16.130. Even a well-designed regulatory architecture cannot generate state capacity 
in isolation. Regulatory institutions operate within a broader political-economic 
equilibrium shaped not only by law and administration, but by the behaviour of the 
actors they regulate. In India, the private corporate sector is not merely a subject of 
regulation; it is a structural participant in the incentive environment that determines 
whether the state upgrades its capacity or governs through discretion.
16.131. The large Indian corporate sector occupies an intermediate position between 
two historical archetypes. It has not functioned as a developmental partner to the state 
in the manner seen in late-industrialising East Asia, where firms actively demanded 
state competence and discipline. Nor has it behaved like the arm’s-length, rules-
bound corporate sector typical of mature Western economies. Instead, it operates 
in a hybrid zone where rents are available, enforcement is uneven, and political 
mediation substitutes for market discipline. Three structural characteristics define this 
equilibrium.
16.132. First, there is a relative lack of willingness and appetite to invest efforts towards 
long-term risk absorption and becoming globally competitive. Regulatory arbitrage, 
protected margins, and firm-specific accommodations often dominate productivity 
enhancement, scale competition, or learning-by-doing. This preference is rational 
in an environment where downside risks are socialised through bailouts, banking 
forbearance, tariff protection, or retrospective renegotiation. A corporate sector that 
externalises risk to the state does not exert pressure for higher state capacity; instead, it 
generates demand for discretion. Discretion, in turn, corrodes rule-based institutions.
16.133. Second, capital allocation horizons remain short. Despite notable exceptions, 
Indian corporate investment is characterised by low R&D intensity, caution in 
frontier manufacturing, and concentration in real estate–linked, regulated, or quasi-
monopolistic sectors. This reflects not merely culture, but governance structures—family

control, succession orientation, weak managerial labour markets, and underdeveloped 
long-horizon capital. When firms do not require fast courts, skilled labour at scale, or 
predictable regulation to generate returns, they cannot function as a forcing mechanism 
for institutional upgrading. Comparative experience shows that corporates induce state 
upgrading only under specific conditions, when productivity is the sole path to survival 
(See Box XVI.8).
Box XVI.8: Profit, Capability and National Purpose: International Precedents
The historical record provides numerous instances where business leaders and firms 
acted not merely as profit-seeking entities but as institutional partners in broader national 
projects, particularly during periods of reconstruction or strategic transformation. 
In post-war America, the corporate sector internalised a nation-building role in two 
overlapping arenas: reconstruction abroad and technology-industrial leadership at home. 
Large manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford, and Caterpillar were not only rebuilding 
their balance sheets but also supplying machinery, vehicles, and industrial equipment that 
underwrote the Marshall Plan’s reconstruction of Europe. 
Their participation was commercially profitable, yet it simultaneously advanced an explicit 
American objective of stabilising allies, rebuilding markets, and containing communism. 
The post-war research orientation of companies such as Bell Labs, IBM, and RCA similarly 
reflected a fusion of corporate strategy and national purpose. Investment in semiconductors, 
computing, communications, and aerospace served the Cold War technological race but 
also generated foundational public goods in science and engineering. Senior executives 
frequently framed these choices in civic language — as duties to “national strength” and 
“modernisation” — and willingly accepted long investment horizons and collaboration with 
universities and federal laboratories. The American private sector’s role in the interstate 
highway system, defence contracting, and space exploration likewise married commercial 
incentives with a shared understanding that corporate capacity was an instrument of 
national modernity and geopolitical credibility.
West Germany’s story after 1945 illustrates a different but related ethic. The rebuilding of 
German industry occurred in a context where corporate leaders explicitly embraced “Soziale 
Marktwirtschaft,” the social market economy, as a moral and national settlement. Firms such 
as Siemens, BASF, and Volkswagen operated under strong expectations of codetermination, 
vocational training, and wage-productivity bargains that supported social stability and rapid 
reconstruction. Their export orientation was not presented as narrow profit maximisation 
but as a route to restoring Germany’s legitimacy, rebuilding employment, and anchoring 
the country within Europe. Business federations worked closely with regional banks and 
the Mittelstand, accepting constraints on price behaviour and capital allocation to sustain 
production, apprenticeships, and technological upgrading. In effect, the private sector 
absorbed part of the burden of national rehabilitation, treating competitiveness and social 
cohesion as mutually reinforcing obligations.

Economic Survey 2025-26
674

Japan’s post-war industrialisation offers another powerful example of how private 
enterprise internalised national purpose. Major firms organised within keiretsu groupings 
pursued profits, but they also accepted coordinated investment, export discipline, and 
technology-acquisition strategies aligned with national upgrading ambitions. Companies 
such as Toyota, Sony, and Nippon Steel invested heavily in process quality, productivity, 
and engineering even when short-term returns were uncertain. Corporate leaders publicly 
cast these choices as contributions to Japan’s recovery and international standing, and 
there was a strong cultural framing of the firm as a national institution rather than merely a 
private property. The “catch-up” imperative created a moral economy in which managerial 
prestige was tied to moving the nation up the technological ladder, not simply to dividend 
payouts. Even intense domestic competition operated within this shared horizon of national 
advancement.
The later East Asian experiences in Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore similarly reveal business 
traditions that bound private gain to national transformation. In Korea, the rise of the 
chaebol — Samsung, Hyundai, LG — is often described in terms of state guidance. Still, it is 
equally a story of corporate elites internalising an export-national mission. These firms took 
on highly leveraged investments, diversified into technologically demanding industries, 
and accepted exposure to international competition as proof of national capability. Senior 
leadership routinely articulated performance in terms of patriotic achievement, and internal 
cultures emphasised sacrifice, discipline, and organisational loyalty as national virtues. 
Profitability remained essential, but prestige was derived from elevating Korea’s industrial 
status and earning foreign exchange for the country.
Taiwan offers a contrasting but complementary pattern. Its industrialisation was powered less 
by conglomerates and more by dense networks of small and medium-sized firms embedded 
in local communities and global supply chains. These enterprises frequently reinvested 
surpluses in skills, machinery, and export learning, and treated participation in the island’s 
transformation as a civic project. Business associations coordinated standards, technology 
diffusion, and supplier upgrading in ways that strengthened collective competitiveness 
rather than merely protecting individual margins. The private sector thus functioned as the 
backbone of a wider developmental coalition, with entrepreneurial success imagined as a 
contribution to national resilience and external security.
Singapore’s case highlights yet another modality of alignment between corporate strategy 
and national interest. Private firms operated alongside government-linked companies and 
sovereign investment arms, but many domestic and multinational enterprises internalised 
the city-state’s ethos of excellence, reliability, and global trustworthiness. Businesses 
adopted rigorous standards, workforce development, and long-term investments in logistics, 
finance, and advanced manufacturing because these were understood to serve not only 
corporate interests but also Singapore’s reputation and survival as a small, trade-dependent 
nation. Corporate leaders often spoke in the idiom of stewardship: firms were expected 
to be custodians of national credibility in global markets, and commercial behaviour was 
evaluated accordingly.

Building Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
675
675
Across these very different contexts, what stands out is not uniform policy design but a shared 
moral framing of enterprise. Business leaders viewed their firms as institutions embedded 
in a national project, and willingly accepted constraints, risks, or long-term horizons 
when these advanced collective goals, such as reconstruction, technological upgrading, 
export capability, social stability, or geopolitical standing. Profit and national interest 
were not seen as antagonists to be reconciled after the fact, but as dimensions of the same 
vocation.
National transformation is most durable when business leaders see themselves not merely 
as beneficiaries of growth but as trustees of a larger developmental project. The most 
successful corporate histories in post-war America, Germany, Japan, and East Asia were 
marked by firms that invested ahead of immediate returns, treated technological capability 
and workforce upgrading as civic obligations, and derived legitimacy from strengthening 
national resilience, enhancing export competitiveness, and promoting social stability. Their 
pursuit of profit was not suspended; rather, it was embedded within a moral economy in 
which reputation, prestige, and long-term value were tied to advancing national capability 
rather than extracting short-term gains. The underlying ethic was one of stewardship: 
firms imagined themselves as institutions of the nation, not just participants in its 
markets.
For India, this implies a private sector that is willing to accept longer investment horizons in 
innovation, skills, and quality; one that treats formalisation, productivity, and technological 
deepening as collective goods rather than optional strategies; and one that recognises its 
role in shaping social trust and institutional credibility. It calls for business leadership that 
is comfortable with competition at global standards, that reinvests success into capability 
building rather than financial engineering, and that frames corporate ambition in terms of 
what it does for India’s productive base, employment quality and international standing. In 
a society undergoing rapid structural change, the private sector’s legitimacy will increasingly 
rest on its ability to marry commercial dynamism with a conscious contribution to nation-
building, not as a slogan, but as a guiding discipline in strategy, capital allocation and 
organisational culture.
16.134. Third, political economy experience shows that when firms cannot rely on 
protection, discretion, or rent extraction and must compete on productivity, quality, and 
export performance, they develop a direct interest in strong, predictable, and impartial 
public institutions. In this sense, productive firms can act as a forcing mechanism for 
higher state capacity.
16.135. Yet, state capacity is not shaped by firms alone. Public institutions ultimately 
operate through everyday interactions with individuals and households, whose 
compliance behaviour, expectations of fairness, and willingness to engage with formal 
systems are equally decisive. The private sector, therefore, must be understood not only 
as a collection of enterprises, but also as a society of citizens. It is to this broader societal 
role in achieving Viksit Bharat that we now turn.

Economic Survey 2025-26

Citizens, norms, and the social foundations of capability
16.136. If the private corporate sector co-shapes the incentive environment in which 
state capacity evolves, citizens shape it even more pervasively through the daily norms 
that determine whether public systems must rely on enforcement or can function 
through internalised responsibility.
16.137. The Indian state today operates under intense pressure: to deliver growth, 
manage distributional conflict, maintain macroeconomic stability, absorb geopolitical 
shocks, and prepare for technological disruption, all while operating within democratic, 
judicial, and media constraints. In such an environment, the cost of enforcement rises 
sharply. Every rule that must be policed rather than internalised, every policy that must 
be coerced rather than complied with, every reform that is litigated socially before it 
is debated intellectually, consumes scarce administrative bandwidth. This is where 
the behaviour of citizens, often treated as a secondary or moral question, becomes a 
primary variable in political economy.
16.138. In a world that is changing faster than most people can fully process, the role of 
citizens is no longer limited to voting, paying taxes, or following rules. It shows up in the 
way people live their daily lives, how they learn, how they treat their work, how they care 
for their bodies and minds, how they handle disappointment, and how they think about 
the future of their children. Development, in that sense, is not something that happens 
“out there”, in ministries and boardrooms; it happens in homes, neighbourhoods, 
workshops, offices, and factory floors, through the quiet habits people build every day.
16.139. Technology is bringing this reality closer to individuals than ever before. For 
years, people believed that as long as one had a degree and a “respectable” job, the world 
would not change too much around them. But artificial intelligence has unsettled that 
comfort. Many kinds of work that once felt secure, such as drafting emails, compiling 
reports, and processing information, can now be done faster by machines. This does 
not make people useless; it simply changes where human worth is expressed.
16.140. It shifts value toward things that depend on care, discipline, skill, and 
judgement, fixing a machine so that a line does not stop, handling a complex delivery 
schedule without chaos, building something with the hands and taking pride in its 
finish, working with others calmly when things go wrong. These are not “lesser” forms 
of work. They are the kinds of work on which reliability rests, and reliability is what 
allows large systems such as ports, highways, hospitals, power grids to function without 
constant breakdowns.
16.141. To thrive in such a world, people need to think of learning as a lifelong companion 
rather than a phase that ends with a certificate. That learning may not always come from 

Building Strategic Resilience and Strategic Indispensability
677
677
courses or formal training. It may come from listening to a younger colleague explain a 
new tool, from being willing to move into a different role, or from admitting that an old 
method is no longer the best. The humility to adapt without feeling diminished will be 
as important as raw intelligence.
16.142. But this transition is not only about skills. It is also about how people hold 
themselves together in an age that constantly pulls at their attention. Many lives today 
are lived through screens, constantly scrolling, reacting, and comparing. Over time, 
this drains energy, leaving people anxious, restless, and prone to anger. When that 
becomes the emotional climate of a society, it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain 
effort over extended periods. Work feels heavier, patience wears thin, and everything 
becomes urgent even when it is not.
16.143. Looking after one’s physical health, protecting sleep, finding time for quiet or 
for exercise, learning to step away from social media before it consumes the day — these 
are not indulgences. They are forms of self-care that strengthen the ability to work 
steadily, to think clearly, and to respond with maturity rather than impulse. A society 
that values reliability must also value the inner stability that makes reliability possible.
16.144. This connects, in a deeper way, to how people think about comfort and sacrifice. 
Development always involves some trade-off between what feels good now and what 
pays off later. It may mean waiting at a red light even when the road appears empty, 
spending a little extra time to do a job properly instead of cutting corners, or accepting 
inconvenience when a city is being rebuilt. These may look like small inconveniences, 
but together they create an environment where systems run smoothly rather than 
constantly fight friction. Where people constantly negotiate rules or look for shortcuts, 
the state has to tighten enforcement, create more paperwork, and spend energy policing 
behaviour, which slows everything down and makes everything more frustrating for 
everyone.
16.145. In India, this tension is visible most sharply in the contrast between how people 
care for their private spaces and how they behave in the commons. Homes are often 
kept with great diligence, and personal hygiene and domestic order are observed with 
discipline and pride. Yet the ethic weakens once one steps outside the door. Streets, 
drains, railway tracks and vacant plots are treated as spaces without a custodian, and 
therefore without obligation. Other societies that have fared better on public hygiene, 
from Sri Lanka to parts of Africa and Latin America, have not produced more fastidious 
individuals inside their homes. They have raised the moral status of the commons to 
the level of the household. Public space is seen not as a zone of no responsibility but 
as an extension of shared life. Where that sensibility takes root, and where the state 
matches it with predictable collection, maintenance and civic services, behaviour shifts

from indifference to stewardship. The difference, in that sense, lies less in individual 
virtue than in whether collective spaces are experienced as worthy of care. Chapter 15 
on urbanisation covered this issue in detail.
16.146. The same logic extends to public money. Handouts and freebies can be a 
compassionate gesture in the present, especially when people are struggling. But they 
are not paid by anybody. Much of the cost is pushed into the future through borrowing, 
and it is the next generation that must work longer and harder to repay it. In an 
emotional sense, this is easy to forget because the burden is invisible — no one sees 
the child who will one day pay the interest on today’s promises. But the burden is real, 
and recognising it is part of what it means to act as responsible citizens rather than as 
short-term beneficiaries.
16.147. None of this is about asking people to become saints or to live lives of constant 
restraint. It is about recognising that the world India is entering is more competitive, 
more interconnected, and more technologically driven. It is also a world that rewards 
steadiness, skill, and maturity. A country cannot scale industries, logistics, or complex 
supply chains unless millions of people, across thousands of moments every day, show 
up on time, do their work with care, and hold themselves to standards even when no 
one is watching.
16.148. The deeper lesson is that capability in a society is co-produced. When citizens 
experience public systems as reliable, they are more willing to internalise norms of 
responsibility in shared spaces; when those norms take hold, the state spends less 
energy on policing and paperwork and more on solving problems that truly require 
authority and expertise. The commons is therefore not a peripheral arena but a quiet 
test of alignment between behaviour and institutions. Where private discipline coexists 
with public indifference, the machinery of the state is drawn into constant enforcement; 
where the ethic of care extends beyond the household into the civic realm, institutional 
capacity expands without the need for dramatic reforms or grand programmes. It is in 
this reciprocal strengthening — between how people live their everyday lives and how 
systems respond — that the foundations of durable capability are laid.
16.149. When citizens treat learning as a habit, respect physical and technical work, care 
for their own health and emotional balance, use technology without becoming captive 
to it, and understand that today’s comfort can sometimes become tomorrow’s burden, 
they do more than improve their own lives. They make the state’s job easier, reduce 
the need for constant enforcement, and create the trust on which institutional capacity 
grows. In that quiet alignment between how people live and how systems function lies 
the real strength of a society that wants to rise without losing its balance.

Delayed Gratification and the Cost of Impatience
16.150. Another recurring but underappreciated constraint on India’s development 
trajectory is the difficulty of sustaining delayed gratification. Competing in the global 
big league, whether in manufacturing, logistics, institutions, or elite sports, requires 
incurring near-term costs for returns that are uncertain, delayed, and often invisible 
in the short term. Where delayed gratification weakens, systems begin to substitute 
shortcuts for capability, visibility for depth, and speed for learning.
16.151. A common misunderstanding is to treat “working smart” as the opposite of 
“working hard”. In practice, working smart is the result of working hard over time. 
Shortcuts are not discovered first and applied later; they are earned only after long 
exposure to detail, repetition, and error. One has to put in the hours before one can 
see which steps can be skipped. One has to learn the full complexity of a task before 
knowing which details truly matter. And one has to do the work wrong many times 
before discovering how to do it right. Delayed gratification is therefore not a moral 
virtue, but a productive capability.
16.152. Recent developments in Indian sport illustrate what happens when this 
sequence is inverted. Accelerated entry into professional leagues through short-format 
performance, limited competitive exposure, or social-media visibility has lowered entry 
barriers and expanded access. Yet it has also weakened the long apprenticeship that 
builds endurance, judgement, and technique. The costs are not immediately visible, but 
they accumulate quietly.
16.153. A related manifestation is the persistence of doping violations. Performance-
enhancing substances offer immediate gains by bypassing the slow, disciplined work 
of training, recovery, and incremental improvement. While enforcement and testing 
matter, the deeper issue is behavioural. When delayed gratification breaks down, 
systems become vulnerable to shortcuts that deliver short-term results at the expense 
of long-term credibility. Trust and legitimacy collapse far faster than they can be rebuilt.
16.154. These tendencies are not confined to sport. They mirror everyday practices 
such as queue-jumping, informal compliance, unsafe construction, and negotiated 
enforcement that offer convenience to individuals while imposing diffuse and lasting 
costs on the system. An ‘India Today’ cover story from the late 1990s characterised the 
‘Ugly Indian’11 not as immoral, but as convenience-seeking, willing to bend rules, cut 
corners, and externalise costs while still aspiring to status and scale. The underlying 
pattern remains familiar: institutions are created, but the norms that sustain them 
are weak; laws exist, but compliance is often negotiated; and outcomes are demanded 
without the corresponding effort.
