    "This page has been left blank",
    "This chapter offers a comprehensive analysis of India's evolving services sector, which has become the principal engine of economic growth, resilience, and structural transformation. Against a backdrop of global uncertainty and subdued global industrial activity, the services sector has emerged as a stabilising force, contributing more than half of India’s Gross Value Added and serving as a major driver of exports and employment. The chapter situates India’s performance within global trends, highlighting the sector’s rapid expansion in digitally delivered, knowledge-intensive, and experience-led segments, as well as its comparative strength in trade and foreign direct investment.",
    "Through a detailed examination of recent developments and high-frequency indicators, the chapter demonstrates how services have underpinned economic momentum, buffered external shocks, and supported urban employment dynamics. Sub-sector analyses-spanning tourism, IT and IT-enabled services, transport, telecommunications, real estate, media and entertainment, and space services-reveal both the diversity and the emerging opportunities within the sector. The discussion brings out critical reform measures, including developing new niche areas like the Orange economy, new hiking trails, marina development and Ocean commercialisation so that India’s services sector remains a powerful engine of sustained and inclusive economic growth in the years ahead."

In recent years, global output expansion has moderated, constrained by subdued industrial activity, supply-chain realignments, and heightened geopolitical uncertainty. Amid these headwinds, the services sector has emerged as a stabilising force, contributing more to the growth. Notably, while global goods trade has stagnated, services trade has continued to expand, reinforcing its role as a critical buffer against external shocks and volatility.1"

They do not require ports to function efficiently, customs to clear on time, industrial land to be assembled at scale, or municipal services to work reliably. As a result, services firms can succeed inside what is otherwise a weak or fragmented state."

That is, when goods exporters face domestic bottlenecks—such as ports, power, logistics, and inspection regimes—they must address them or fail. Their capital is sunk, their supply chains are rooted, and exit is costly and visible. Services firms, by contrast, can relocate teams, invoice through offshore entities, arbitrage jurisdictions, or simply shift work across borders with relatively low friction. When institutions become burdensome, the most productive firms leave quietly. That behaviour is rational at the firm level but is unhelpful at the system level, because it removes precisely the actors who might otherwise pressure the state to improve."

On the other hand, services exports, even when large in foreign exchange terms, are far less employment- intensive per dollar earned, geographically concentrated, and weakly linked to domestic supply chains. A slowdown hurts incomes in specific urban clusters but does not affect macroeconomic stability in the same way."

Against this global backdrop, going forward, sustaining India’s position in the global services market will depend on productivity gains, continued innovation, ongoing investment in skills aligned with emerging technologies, and further simplification of regulatory processes.

Tourism requires the creation of niche segments, such as long-distance hiking trails, and a national marina development policy to unlock the blue economy. Streamlining permissions for live events, opening up heritage venues, and facilitating foreign artist participation will help realise the potential of the concert and orange economies.
