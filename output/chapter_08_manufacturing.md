INDUSTRY'S NEXT 
LEAP: STRUCTURAL 
TRANSFORMATION AND 
GLOBAL INTEGRATION
The industrial sector in FY 2025-26 continued to display resilience and further 
regained momentum despite persistent global headwinds. This momentum is 
underpinned partly by the shift towards high-technology manufacturing. This 
transition reflects global trends wherein competitiveness hinges less on cost 
arbitrage and more on strategic indispensability within Global Value Chains 
(GVCs). India’s long-term success will depend on its ability to integrate into 
GVCs as a high-tech, high-productivity manufacturing hub supported by stable 
and innovation-friendly policies.
Flagship policy initiatives of the Government are anchoring this transformation. 
The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme continues to attract substantial 
investments and drive domestic value addition, particularly in electronics 
and emerging technology segments. Complementing this, the National 
Manufacturing Mission sets a long-term blueprint to boost the manufacturing 
sector substantially. A critical focus is on transitioning India from a 
technology adopter to a global innovator and scaling up the MSMEs for global 
competitiveness. The innovation ecosystem is being strengthened through the 
establishment of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) and the 
Research, Development & Innovation (RDI) Fund, which aim to crowd-in private 
R&D and accelerate leadership in strategic sectors such as semiconductors. 
Parallelly, a strong thrust on infrastructure and logistics efficiency—through 
initiatives like PM GatiShakti and National Industrial Corridor Development 
Programme—is contributing towards enhancing cost competitiveness.
The path to Viksit Bharat @2047 requires strategic resilience and continuous 
ascent within the GVCs. Sustained reforms across five pillars- Ease of Doing 
Business, R&D and innovation, Skilling, Infrastructure & Logistics, and Scaling 
up of MSMEs- will remain critical in positioning industry as a key engine of 
future growth. 
GLOBAL MANUFACTURING: UNEVEN RECOVERY AND THE 
SHIFT TOWARDS HIGH-TECH VALUE CHAINS

chain realignments among other factors. Despite a steady first half, the global outlook 
remains subdued, with risks tilted to the downside.1
8.2.	 Though the world manufacturing output as a whole, expanded by 0.7 per cent in 
Q3 of 2025 (calendar year), the performance across regions remained uneven. Africa 
led manufacturing growth in Q3 2025, followed by Asia and Oceania. While Latin 
America and the Caribbean witnessed a decline, the Europe experienced stagnation.2 
India maintained strong industrial growth during the same period, placing it among 
the fastest growing industrial performers globally.

8.3.	 Global manufacturing continues to shift towards higher-value, innovation-
intensive activities. Medium- and high-technology industries expanded by 1.7 per cent 
and 1.4 per cent in Q2 and Q3 of 2025 respectively, significantly outpacing stagnant 
low-tech segments.3  The UNCTAD World Investment Report 20254 notes, ‘investment 
in the digital economy and technology continues to act as a growth engine.’	
8.4.	 Alongside this technological shift, countries are also recalibrating their industrial 
strategies to reduce vulnerability to external disruption and enhance their leverage 
within global production networks by securing reliable positions in key areas of the 
global value chain.

8.5.	 Collectively, these trends suggest that the next phase of global manufacturing will 
be shaped less by simple cost arbitrage and more by strategic indispensability. Future 
success will depend on a country’s preparedness and capacity to embed itself into 
GVCs as a high-tech, highly productive manufacturing hub supported by a stable policy 
environment.
DOMESTIC  DEVELOPMENTS: RESILIENCE AND 
STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION
8.6.	 Against this backdrop, India’s industrial performance remains robust. Industry 
Gross Value Added (GVA) grew by 7.0 per cent year-on-year, in real terms, in the first 
half of FY2025-26, marking a clear pickup after growth had eased to 5.9 per cent in the 
previous fiscal year (FY2024-25).

8.7. 	Worldwide, manufacturing activity softened across major economies through 
2024 and early 2025, with some advanced economies even experiencing stagnation. 
This global deceleration dampened trade, investment, and order books everywhere, 
creating spillovers that inevitably impacted the Indian economy. Consequently, the 
easing in FY25 reflected a broader cooling of global demand rather than a weakening of 
India’s underlying industrial capabilities.
8.8.	 This is further reinforced by the recovery witnessed in FY 2025-26, as 
Manufacturing GVA grew by 7.72 per cent and 9.13 per cent in Q1 and Q2, respectively, 
primarily driven by ongoing structural shifts within the sector. These include a gradual

move toward higher-value manufacturing segments, improved availability of industrial 
infrastructure through corridor-led development, and greater adoption of technology 
and formalisation across firms. This reflects India’s improved industrial capability. 
8.9.	 Medium and high-technology activities now account for 46.3 per cent of India’s 
total manufacturing value added.5 This positions India among a relatively small group of 
middle-income industrialising economies that are steadily moving towards sophisticated 
production structures. This shift is due to various government initiatives such as the 
Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes and the India Semiconductor Mission, 
alongside the strengthening of domestic capacities in electronics, pharmaceuticals, 
chemicals and transportation sectors. Consequently, India’s global standing has 
strengthened, as its ranking in terms of Competitive Industrial Performance (CIP) 
improved to 37th in 2023, up from 40th position in 2022.

8.10.	 Forward-looking indicators continue to signal optimism within India’s industrial 
sector. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) has remained well above 
the expansion threshold of 50 between March 2023 and the present, with both the 
headline index and its six-month moving average fluctuating comfortably in the mid-
50s to high-50s range (Chart VIII.5). This stability suggests broad-based confidence 
in current operating conditions, order books, and production plans. A similar trend 
is also seen in the RBI’s Business Expectations Index, which has consistently stayed 
above the neutral benchmark of 100 through FY25 and into Q2 FY26, signaling positive 
sentiment regarding future output, employment, and investment. Together, these 
indicators reinforce the continued resilience of industry sentiment and reflect a business 
environment where firms remain confident about demand and growth prospects.

8.11.		 Overall, India’s industrial sector continues to emerge as a key contributor of 
resilience and growth amidst the challenging global industrial landscape. Even as 
the global industrial production grows slowly, India’s consistent expansion, growing 
technological depth, and rising global presence underline its potential to remain a 
bright spot in the world economy. 
8.12.	 Given the sector's strategic vitality, significant employment potential, and deep 
economic linkages, a more concerted focus is required on five structural pillars of 
competitiveness: strengthening the regulatory environment for ease of doing business; 
boosting innovation and R&D; addressing skill gaps for future workforce needs; 
enhancing infrastructure and logistics to lower costs; and scaling up the MSME sector 
for global competition.
Industrial credit
8.13.	 Though bank-based industrial credit growth from commercial banks moderated 
to 8.24 per cent in FY25 compared with 9.39 per cent in FY24, assessments indicate an 
ongoing diversification of funding sources away from banks. The Monthly Economic 
Review of August 2025 noted, ‘decrease in bank credit coincides with the increase in 
the overall flow of financial resources to the commercial sector. This shift could be 
due to the large corporations increasingly relying on market-based instruments such 
as commercial paper and corporate bonds for their funding requirements’.6  Financial 
flows from non-bank sources to the commercial sector recorded a CAGR of 17.32 per cent 
over the period FY20 to FY25. Furthermore, the total flow of financial resources from 
domestic sources to the commercial sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience,

growing at a CAGR of 28.6 per cent since FY20.7 These trends highlight how effectively 
the financial resources are growing from non-bank sources, offsetting the moderation 
in credit from bank sources.8

8.14.	 Against this backdrop, the moderation in bank credit flow to industry—though 
still growing at a rate above 8 per cent in FY25—should be seen as a sign of an ongoing 
structural adjustment. Diversification of finance sourcing by industries is expected to 
improve stability, reduce cyclical dependence on bank credit, and align funding more 
closely with firms’ balance sheet strength. The growing depth of the corporate bond 
markets and non-bank financing channels is expected to create an industrial credit 
landscape supportive of higher investment with lower systemic risk.

8.15.	 The subsequent sections of this chapter are organized as follows. The next two 
sections provide an overview of progress and policy measures across various industrial 
segments, including core input industries and capital and consumer goods sectors. 
This is followed by high-growth sector spotlights, offering in-depth analyses of selected 
sectors—electronics, automotive, and pharmaceuticals—focusing on exports, value-
added activities, and technology adoption, as well as flagship initiatives to promote 
manufacturing. This is followed by a brief discussion on the cross-cutting structural 
pillars of competitiveness: innovation and R&D, regulatory reforms [including a 
review of Quality Control Orders (QCOs)], infrastructure and logistics, and scaling up 
the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The final section concludes the 
discussion and presents an indicative roadmap towards greater integration with the 
GVCs.
CORE INPUT INDUSTRIES
Cement
8.16.	 India is the second-largest cement producer in the world after China. The Indian 
cement industry comprises 160 integrated large cement plants, 130 grinding units and 
62 mini cement plants. The current annual installed capacity of the cement industry 
in India is about 690 million tonnes, with cement production of around 453 million 
tonnes in FY25.9 Most of the cement plants in India are located near the raw material 
sources. About 85 per cent of the cement industry is concentrated in the states of 
Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil 
Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal. The industry has 
adequate installed capacity to meet the domestic demand for cement. Domestic cement 
consumption in India is approximately 290 kg per capita, compared to a global average 
of 540 kg per capita.10

Steel
8.18.	 The steel sector serves as the backbone of industrialisation and infrastructure, 
securing India’s position as the world's second-largest crude steel producer. The sector 
has undergone a major transformation in the last five years, largely driven by strong 
domestic demand from the construction and manufacturing sectors.

8.20.	 To sustain the sector's robust growth and foster self-reliance, the Government 
launched the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Specialty Steel in 2021, 
with an outlay of ₹6,322 crore, aimed at promoting high-value, niche products. As of 
October 2025, cumulative investment under the PLI scheme reached ₹23,022 crore, 
with production of 2.34 million tonnes (MT) of specialty steel.12
8.21. However, the sector faces challenges related to international price disparity and 
raw material security.13 India was a net importer of steel during FY26 (April–October), 
primarily due to low international prices which resulted in lower margins on exports 
and cheaper imports. While India is largely self-sufficient in iron ore, the industry 
faces critical dependence on imported Coking Coal. To mitigate global supply risks, 
the Ministry of Coal launched Mission Coking Coal in 2022 with a view to significantly 
enhance domestic raw coking coal production to 140 MT by 2030. 
Coal
8.22.	 With the fifth-largest coal reserves and as the second-largest consumer, coal 
remains crucial, contributing 55 per cent to the national energy mix and fuelling over 
74 per cent of total power generation.14 India's coal industry reached historic heights 
in FY25, producing 1,047.52 Million Tonnes (MT) of coal—a 4.98 per cent increase 
from the previous year's 997.83 MT. This represents the highest coal production 
the country has ever achieved, demonstrating the industry's impressive growth and

importance to India's energy needs.  Concurrently, the total coal supply surged by 5.38 
per cent, reaching 1,025.33 MT in FY25. Driven by this strong domestic output, imports 
registered a significant 7.9 per cent decline, falling from 264.53 MT in FY24 to 243.62 
MT in FY25.15 Furthermore, the ratio of domestic production to consumption has also 
steadily improved over the past decade, as production growth has consistently outpaced 
consumption growth (Chart VIII.10).

Capital Goods
8.25.	 The export performance of the Capital Goods sector since FY22 is closely aligned 
with the expansion in domestic production capacity and the strengthening of domestic 
investment activity. Simultaneously, imports have registered consistent growth, 
reflecting robust domestic investment demand, as well as a reliance on technologically 
advanced imported machinery. Overall, these dual trends indicate strong domestic 
investment cycles but also indicate the continuing need to reduce dependence on 
imported high-tech capital goods.

8.26.	 The Government is actively trying to enhance the competitiveness of the Capital 
Goods Sector through Phase II of the Scheme on Enhancement of Competitiveness 
in the Indian Capital Goods Sector, launched in 2022. The scheme focuses on six 
core components, including the identification of technologies through technology 
innovation portals, the establishment of new Advanced Centres of Excellence (CoEs), 
Common Engineering Facility Centres (CEFCs), the upgradation of existing testing and 
certification centres, alongside robust skilling initiatives. Under Phase II of the Scheme, 
a total of 29 projects with total cost of ₹891.37 crore with government contribution 
of ₹714.64 crore have been sanctioned, as of November 2025. Many technologies 
developed under the scheme have also captured export markets in countries such as 
France, Belgium, Qatar and others.18
Automobile
8.27.	 The automotive industry is a significant driver of economic growth, with India 
established as the world’s largest market for Two-Wheelers and Three-Wheelers and 
the third-largest market globally for Passenger Vehicles (PV) and Commercial Vehicles 
(CV). Supported by a vast manufacturing and auto component ecosystem, the sector 
provides direct and indirect employment to over 30 million people and contributes 
significantly to public finances, accounting for nearly 15 per cent of the country’s GST 
collections.19  
8.28.	 The industry is also witnessing tremendous growth in exports, with more than 
5.3 million vehicles shipped across Passenger, Commercial, Two-Wheeler, and Three-
Wheeler segments in the FY25 and posting double-digit growth in the H1 of 2025-26, 
reflecting rising global acceptance of India-made vehicles. Overall, the industry has

8.37.	 While India's textiles sector possesses significant intrinsic strengths, the sector 
faces challenges such as, small scale and fragmentation of the value chain, heavy 
reliance on cotton [which contrasts with the global market's focus on Man-Made Fibres 
(MMF)], limited FDI and technology adoption. To drive a structural transformation, the 
Government has taken several initiatives such as the launch of the PM-Mega Integrated 
Textile Region and Apparel Parks (PM-MITRA) Scheme to facilitate economies of scale 
and reduce logistics costs; revision to the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme 
for MMF and Technical Textiles in October 2025 to encourage fresh investments and 
ease entry barriers such as expansion of eligible MMF and technical textile product 
lines; reduction in minimum investment thresholds (from ₹300 crore to ₹150 crore 
and from ₹100 crore to ₹50 crore); and lowering the incremental turnover requirement 
from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.
8.38.	 Furthermore, to alleviate raw material constraints and reduce production costs, 
the Government strategically revoked multiple Quality Control Orders (QCOs) in the 
MMF and viscose value chains in November 2025.27 Besides, the technical textiles 
segment has been supported by the National Technical Textile Mission (NTTM), 
launched with an outlay of ₹1,480 crore (2020-21 to 2025-26), which focuses on R&D, 
market development, and skill development to position India as a global leader in 
technical textiles. 
27 	Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals (DCPC) revoked 14 QCOs—seven of them relating to the polyester 
value chain—on 12 November 2025, followed by Ministry of Textiles’ revocation of QCO on viscose staple fibre

KEY INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE MANUFACTURING
Performance Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme
8.39.	 In alignment with India’s vision of ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’, the Production Linked 
Incentive (PLI) Scheme was launched in 2020 and now spanning 14 key sectors, with an 
outlay of ₹1.97 lakh crore. The core purpose of these schemes is to attract investments 
in key sectors and introduce cutting-edge technology, ensure efficiency, and achieve 
economies of size and scale, thereby making Indian companies and manufacturers 
globally competitive. Till September 2025, under the PLI scheme, an actual investment 
of over ₹2.0 lakh crore has been realised, leading to incremental production/sales of 
over ₹18.70 lakh crore and employment generation of over 12.60 lakhs (direct and 
indirect). Cumulative incentives of ₹23,946 crore have been disbursed across 12 sectors, 
with 806 applications approved across all 14 sectors. The PLI Schemes have witnessed 
exports surpassing ₹8.20 lakh crore, driven significantly by sectors like electronics, 
pharmaceuticals, and telecom & networking products.28
8.40.	 Sectoral gains are tangible and worth noting. The electronics sector has emerged 
as a flagship success story under the PLI strategy. The PLI Scheme has encouraged 
major smartphone companies to re-locate their production to India. As a result, 
India has become a major mobile phone manufacturing hub.29 In the first three years, 
pharmaceutical sales under PLI Scheme for Pharmaceuticals crossed ₹2.63 lakh crore, 
including exports worth ₹1.69 lakh crore and overall, Domestic Value Addition in 
the sector has been 83.74 per cent as on March 2025.30 Further, the PLI scheme for 
automobile and auto-components has attracted cumulative investments worth ₹35,657 
crore, resulting in creation of 48,974 jobs, until September 2025.31
National Manufacturing Mission
8.41.	 Complementing PLI, the National Manufacturing Mission (NMM), was 
announced in Union Budget 2025–26. The NMM aims to boost innovation, raise 
competitiveness, and expand manufacturing capacity across priority sectors, 
complementing Make in India and the Atmanirbhar Bharat push. It emphasises faster 
technology adoption and deeper MSME integration into value chains.

Box VIII.4: National Mission on Manufacturing (NMM)*32 
The National Mission on Manufacturing (NMM), announced in the Union Budget 
2025-26, represents the foundational policy blueprint for accelerating India's industrial 
growth and global competitiveness over the next decade. It sets ambitious targets for 2035, 
aiming to double the manufacturing sector’s contribution to GDP from 12.9 per cent (2023) 
to 25 per cent and generate 143 million jobs, along with boosting merchandise exports to 
USD 1.2 trillion by deepening integration into GVCs.
The Mission has a strategic two-pronged approach, dedicating major focus to sector-specific 
interventions across 20 to 30 prioritised industrial clusters. This would entail identifying 
industrial clusters based on parameters such as demand potential, employment generation 
capacity, and presence of natural endowments and classifying sectors into three archetypes: 
Scale (e.g., Automotive, Pharmaceuticals) for rapid expansion; Fix and Transform (e.g., 
Electronics, Capital Goods) for structural reform; and Seed (e.g., Semiconductors, Electric 
Vehicles) for strategic, innovation-led growth. 
The other core activities are expected to address vital, cross-cutting challenges essential 
for competitiveness, including enhancing the Ease of Doing Business, strengthening Plug 
& Play Infrastructure, and improving workforce productivity through targeted skilling, 
empowering MSMEs, prioritising technology and provision of industrial housing. The NMM 
is thus expected to act as the central facilitator to align efforts across the Centre, States, and 
clusters, ensuring unified direction and convergence.
Innovation and R&D: From Adopters to Innovators
8.42.	 India's research and innovation ecosystem has, over the years, strengthened 
significantly, as its standing in scientific research output has risen sharply from the 7th 
position in 2010 to the 3rd  position globally currently in terms of scholarly publications, 
reflecting a sustained expansion of academic research capacity.33 The quality of output 
is also growing: the number of Indian universities in the 2026 Quacquarelli Symonds 
(QS) World University Rankings saw a five-fold jump, from 11 institutions in 2015 to 54 
in 2026, making India the fourth most-represented country in the rankings.34
8.43.	 The country's ranking in the Global Innovation Index (GII) improved from 66th 
in 2019 to 38th in 2025. This places India at the top of the rankings within the lower-
middle-income country group and first in the Central and Southern Asia region.35

Box VIII.5: CSIR Progress in Applied Innovation
Over the last year and a half, between FY25 and the first half of FY26, the Council of Scientific 
and Industrial Research (CSIR) has demonstrated tangible progress in advancing applied 
research and translating it into deployable solutions across strategic sectors including 
infrastructure, health, chemicals, energy, aerospace, biotechnology and defence. Shifting 
from laboratory-oriented research towards impact-oriented research and facilitating 
technology transfer, CSIR has been working steadily towards supporting national goals of 
Aatmanirbharta and technology-led growth. 
A key driver of CSIR’s recent progress has been mission-mode innovation in infrastructure 
and materials. Indigenous technologies such as REJUPAVE and the ECOFIX pothole repair

system, designed for challenging terrain, are already deployed by the Border Roads 
Organisation (BRO) in high-altitude regions and are being increasingly adopted by state 
agencies. Complementing these are early deployments of India’s first bio-bitumen highway, 
steel-slag road infrastructure, and trials with end-of-life plastics, all signalling a clear shift 
towards circular economy-aligned public works and context-specific applied innovation. 
CSIR’s applied innovation portfolio now extends into industrial processes, strategic 
materials, and health technologies with clear deployment pathways. The continuous-zero 
flow, zero-liquid discharge paracetamol production technology developed by CSIR-National 
Chemical Laboratory has already been licensed for commercial use, reducing manufacturing 
costs by an estimated 15-20 per cent. In defence and chemicals, CSIR-Indian Institute of 
Chemical Technology’s (IICT) development of an indigenous process for CL-20 propellant 
materials strengthens self-reliance in high-energy materials. In biotechnology and health, 
CSIR’s innovations range from an affordable molecular diagnostic for sickle cell anaemia to 
advances in gene editing platforms and targeted drug delivery for cancer. Collectively, these 
developments reflect a clear shift from laboratory research to deployable and commercially 
relevant technologies that support nation-building.  
CSIR’s work in applied innovation also extends to frontier technologies. The successful test 
flights of solar-powered high-altitude pseudo satellites (HAPS) capable of long-endurance 
flight for border security and telecom relay demonstrate deep capability development in 
autonomous systems. Likewise, indigenous developments in UAV propulsion engines, 
kamikaze drones, and the partnership with Bharat Electronics Limited for sensor systems 
demonstrate increasing linkages between public research and national defence capability. 
CSIR-NAL’s technology transfer for commercial production of indigenously designed 
trainer aircraft (HANSA-3 NG) is another milestone, marking the first time a homegrown 
civil aircraft platform is moving to commercial manufacturing. 
CSIR’s recent progress demonstrates a maturing model of government-led applied 
innovation, where public R&D is increasingly moving beyond publication and prototyping 
toward deployment, industrial adoption and commercial transfer. By facilitating the 
transition of technologies from research labs to real-world deployment, this approach 
enhances technological self-reliance through faster innovation diffusion while broadening 
India's capacity in strategic and future-oriented fields.
8.47.	 India is also establishing itself as a strong contender in critical technologies. 
The Critical Technology Tracker, published by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute 
(ASPI)40, shows India now ranks among the top five countries in 45 out of 64 critical 
technologies, compared to just 4 technologies in the period from 2003 to 2007. This 
breadth across defence, space, quantum computing, AI, and advanced materials signals 
an expanding strategic capability essential for Aatmanirbharta.

8.48.	 Despite notable progress in research and development, challenges remain, 
primarily concerning R&D expenditure intensity. India's Gross Expenditure on R&D 
(GERD) as a percentage of GDP stands at a modest 0.64 per cent, substantially below 
the global average. Leading economies, such as the US (3.48 per cent), China (2.43 per 
cent), and South Korea (4.91 per cent), invest significantly more. 
8.49.	 Low expenditure in R&D is partly due to low investment in R&D from business 
sector, which accounts for only 41 per cent of the total expenditure. This is in stark 
contrast to countries such as China (77 per cent), United States (75 per cent), and 
South Korea (79 per cent), where business sector contributions to R&D are significantly

higher.41 Bridging this disparity through various measures and fostering a conducive 
environment for private industry is critical for accelerating technological development. 
To drive this endeavour, the government has instituted a series of high-stakes, mission-
driven initiatives.
8.50.	 A major institutional reform driving India’s R&D and aimed at addressing 
the challenges highlighted above is the establishment of the Anusandhan National 
Research Foundation (ANRF) under the ANRF Act, 2023. The ANRF is intended to 
provide strategic direction, competitive funding opportunities and collaboration 
pathways across industry, academia and government. The initiatives taken up by ANRF 
are being complemented by a suite of mission-driven national programmes such as the 
National Quantum Mission, the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical 
Systems, the IndiaAI Mission, the India Semiconductor Mission, and the National 
Green Hydrogen Mission. Each initiative focuses on building foundational scientific 
capability in sunrise domains, translating research into scalable industrial capacity.
8.51.	 To finance innovation at scale, the Government also announced a new Research, 
Development and Innovation (RDI) Fund with a total outlay of ₹1 lakh crore over six 
years and ₹20,000 crore allocated for FY26. The Fund is designed to catalyse private 
investment in high-tech R&D, support projects at advanced technological readiness 
levels, enable acquisition of strategically important technologies, and operationalise 
a Deep-Tech Fund of Funds. Together, the ANRF, the national missions and the RDI 
Fund form a consolidated architecture for expanding India’s GERD beyond its current 
level and accelerating India’s transition towards technological leadership and the 
broader objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat. 
Box VIII.7: Why the India Semiconductor Mission Matters
Microprocessors are products that are largely obscured from view in our day to day lives. 
Yet, they form the heart of our energy systems, financial markets, telecom networks, 
manufacturing units, hospitals, transportation networks, and satellites, among many other 
applications. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities in global semiconductor 
supply chains. Shortages impacted over 169 industries globally, causing price increases and 
production delays.42 The absence of a steady supply of semiconductors is likely to hamper 
economic activities across sectors. Reliance on a handful of suppliers for semiconductors 
is an added risk. The India Semiconductor Mission (ISM), launched in 2021 aims to build 
domestic capacity across design, manufacturing, and innovation in semiconductors and is a 
first step towards in self-sufficiency and technological sovereignty.

Design
Semiconductor manufacturing begins with the design process, which determines the chip’s 
architecture, which optimises parameters such as cost, power consumption and processing 
capabilities, based on the needs of the chip in question, making their designs incredibly 
complex. Progress in chip design requires consistent mix of multidisciplinary research, 
substantial investments, years of R&D for each new chip developed, and a highly skilled 
workforce. This makes semiconductors the most R&D intensive product to produce, even 
more than pharmaceuticals and software. 
The mix of these factors is not something everyone could afford, nor get right, due to which 
the design process of cutting-edge chips is highly concentrated in a few developed nations. 
Global leaders in the design process include the United States, South Korea, Taiwan and 
Japan, who collectively account for 79.4 per cent of the global semiconductor Integrated 
Circuit (IC) design revenue.43 Their edge is also maintained by the sustained investments in 
R&D, allowing them to capitalise on existing intellectual property to further their leadership.44

Manufacturing of semiconductors
The manufacturing phase of semiconductors is resource-intensive, requiring highly 
specialised machinery and facilities. Making semiconductors is extremely resource-intensive 
and depends on very specialised equipment and facilities. A modern semiconductor factory 
can cost around USD 10 billion to set up, largely because the machines used must work 
with nanometre-level precision. The supply of the machines capable of undertaking these 
complex tasks is concentrated with just 5 companies across 4 countries.45

Furthermore, at these nanometre scales, efficient production requires a high degree of 
control over the entire process, with specialised and sensitive equipment. Even here, the 
supply chain is highly concentrated. As of 2021, the United States, Japan and South Korea 
make up two-thirds of the global sales for wafer fabrication, assembly and test equipment. 
Recent geopolitical events underscore a broader lesson: economies that depend on 
external access to foundational technologies increasingly face constraints not just in 
production, but in strategic autonomy. As advanced economies accelerate investments in 
semiconductor capacity and tighten export controls, access to chips becomes a determinant 
of competitiveness and also national security.
The India Semiconductor Mission for a Resilient India
To address structural vulnerabilities and build resilience, the Government of India 
has undertaken a series of coordinated measures to develop an end-to-end domestic 
semiconductor system. The India Semiconductor Mission and the Semicon India programme 
together form the core of this strategy, supported by a ₹76,000 crore incentive framework 
to catalyse investment in fabrication, assembly, testing, marking and packaging facilities. 
Under these programmes, four targeted schemes have been launched, each extending 
fiscal support of 50 per cent of project cost/capex for semiconductor and display fabs, 
compound semiconductor facilities, and outsourced semiconductor assembly and testing 
units, alongside a dedicated Design Linked Incentive scheme to encourage domestic chip 
design. As of August 2025, ten semiconductor manufacturing and packaging projects have 
been approved with a cumulative investment of around ₹1.60 lakh crore in 6 states.46 In 
addition, State Governments have also begun complementing the national framework, 
with initiatives such as Odisha’s Semiconductor Manufacturing and Fabless Policy offering 
additional incentives and institutional support. As execution accelerates and capacity 
expands, these measures are expected to strengthen domestic semiconductor capabilities, 
enhance the resilience of critical supply chains and position India as a significant participant 
in the global semiconductor marketplace.
Quality control: Enhancing global competitiveness
8.52.	 With the goals of the National Manufacturing Mission seeking to position India 
as an indispensable part of GVCs, quality aspect is as critical as cost competitiveness. In 
this context, Quality Control Orders (QCOs) are regulatory instruments that mandate 
conformity with the desired quality standards. The Government of India has significantly 
augmented mandatory quality assurance in India. As of 31 December 2025, a total of 
143 QCOs covering 723 products have been notified by various ministries,47 more than 
tripling the coverage from 214 products in 2019. The purpose of QCOs is to ensure 
that products meet stipulated quality standards, while avoiding market distortions and 
protecting consumer requirements.

Box VIII.8: Quality Control-Towards Pragmatism
In a global environment marked by tightening technical regulations, QCOs are vital 
for addressing and mitigating the reputational risks associated with inadequate and 
inconsistent quality. They level the playing field for firms that invest in quality while curbing 
the influx of substandard imports. In several sectors, the introduction of QCOs for finished 
goods has been accompanied by improved compliance and a reduction in the circulation of 
substandard products including sectors such as toys, transformers, footwear, and cement, 
directly contributing to India's long-term goal of overall improved standards. 
A prominent example of this strategic approach leading to a fundamental trade shift is 
seen in the Toys sector. A Quality Control Order (QCO) for Toys was issued in 2020 w.e.f 
01.01.2021, along with an increase in Basic Customs Duty (from 20 per cent to 60 per cent in 
Feb 2020, and subsequently to 70 per cent in March 2023) and mandatory sample testing of 
each import consignment to curb the import of sub-standard toys. The results demonstrate 
a clear structural transformation: between FY15 and FY23, imports of toys declined by 52 
per cent, while exports soared by 239 per cent.48 Crucially, India transitioned from being a 
net importer (in FY15) to a net exporter of toys from FY21 onwards. This shift was largely 
attributed to the quality regulations and tariff policies allowing domestic manufacturers to 
scale up and meet international quality benchmarks.

Beyond quality, consumer and workplace safety also provide an equally compelling 
justification for mandatory standards. QCOs on products ranging from electrical appliances 
to helmets are essential for protecting public welfare and maintaining market confidence. 
This regulatory enforcement is to be further supported by enhanced surveillance, expanded 
testing infrastructure, and digitised certification processes.
While the rationale is clear, the design and implementation of QCOs should be grounded 
in economic practicality. Mandatory certification, while necessary, is not cost-free and can 
create friction if implemented without adequate preparation and due diligence, especially 
given that Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) form a significant part of India's 
industrial base. MSMEs often lack the capital to establish in-house testing facilities or adapt 
quickly to new certification requirements. Overly narrow transition periods can also lead to 
production delays, supply disruptions, and rising inventory costs, unintentionally burdening 
the firms QCOs are meant to support.
This becomes particularly relevant when QCOs extend to raw materials and intermediate 
inputs. Modern manufacturing is intrinsically linked to global suppliers. Mandating 
certification for specialised raw materials, intermediate inputs, or spare parts—
particularly when domestic alternatives are scarce or non-existent—can inadvertently 
be counterproductive, causing delays in critical downstream sectors such as automotive, 
power, and electronics. QCOs on intermediates, therefore, require exceptional caution, with 
flexibility built in when domestic alternatives do not exist especially in view of complexity of 
modern global supply chains.
Therefore, QCOs should be approached pragmatically as instruments for strengthening 
quality assurance, consumer safety and strategic resilience within increasingly complex 
value chains.49 If regulations are applied without comprehensive value-chain analysis, it 
can trigger cascading consequences, increasing costs and erode cost competitiveness. This 
interconnectedness was famously illustrated by economist Milton Friedman in his 1980 
lecture. Holding up a pencil to the audience, he stated, "…There is not a single person in the 
world who could make this pencil... When you go down to the store and buy this pencil, you 
are in effect trading a few minutes of your time for a few seconds of the time of all those 
thousands of people."50 
A forward-looking QCO framework should, therefore, incorporate a rigorous pre-notification 
assessment, calibrated transition periods (especially for MSMEs), adequate national testing 
capacity, and a clear alignment with industry readiness. Critically, where sufficient domestic 
production capacity does not exist, the framework should provide exemptions or alternative 
pathways for specialised inputs such as raw materials, intermediates, spare parts, and 
quantities required for R&D. The Government recognises the importance of a balanced and 
adaptive approach, with recent regulatory decisions reflecting a willingness to recalibrate 
QCOs.51 This balanced approach will allow QCOs to strengthen India’s manufacturing 
capabilities without imposing undue burdens, ensuring that quality regulation remains a 
strategic enabler of long-term economic growth.

while 3 QCOs covering 63 products and 20 categories of machines and electrical equipment under the Omnibus 
Technical Regulation (OTR), were deferred or suspended by concerned regulators in 2025-26.

Infrastructure and Logistics: Improving Competitiveness
8.53.	 A competitive manufacturing ecosystem relies not only on firm-level productivity 
but also on the efficiency, connectivity and predictability of the infrastructure 
surrounding it. Over the past few years, the infrastructure push has shifted from project-
level execution to systems-level planning. PM GatiShakti represents this structural 
shift by enabling multi-modal planning through a unified geospatial platform. As of 
November 2025, 57 Ministries and Departments have been onboarded, and over 1,700 
data layers have been integrated into the National Master Plan for allowing planners 
to identify bottlenecks, optimise routes, and avoid duplication in capital expenditure.52 
The opening of PM GatiShakti Public and the Unified Geospatial Interface now provides 
private users with access to 230 curated datasets for planning investments and logistics 
strategies. This marks a transition away from Government-only planning to a systematic 
approach of shared national infrastructure intelligence, allowing efficient planning and 
resource utilisation. 
8.54.	 States and districts have also been adopting this framework at scale, with 27 States 
notifying State Logistics Policies and 28 Aspirational Districts using the GatiShakti 
District Master Plan Module for area planning. This will then be extended to all 112 
Aspirational Districts in the near term. Complementing this is the National Logistics 
Policy (NLP) and tools such as Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) and the 
Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP), which benchmark logistics competitiveness 
and integrate data across ministries. ULIP currently connects 44 systems across 11 
ministries through over 2,000 data fields, with more than 1,700 companies registered 
and 200 crore API transactions executed. These investments in planning capability, 
digital integration and logistics intelligence are beginning to improve operational 
predictability for industry.
8.55.	 Infrastructure execution is advancing rapidly through the National Industrial 
Corridor Development Programme, which enables the development of new industrial 
cities with plug-and-play facilities and logistics hubs focused on multimodal connectivity. 
Phase-I cities such as Dholera, Shendra-Bidkin, Greater Noida and Vikram Udyogpuri 
are now operational, with 350 industrial plots allotted and investment of ₹2.02 lakh 
crore across sectors, including electronics, renewables, pharmaceuticals and EVs.53 
Complementing this are sector-specific interventions under the National Logistics 
Policy, such as the Sectoral Plan for Efficient Logistics for the cement industry. The 
industry is expected to experience reductions in its logistics costs through efficiency 
gains from multimodal connectivity and digital transparency.

8.56.	 India’s logistics strategy has transitioned beyond mere asset creation to an 
integrated ecosystem approach, combining physical infrastructure, digital public 
platforms (like ULIP), regulatory simplification, and corridor-based industrialisation 
(PM GatiShakti). This holistic approach aims to minimise logistics friction, financing 
delays, and coordination losses that previously constrained industrial competitiveness.
8.57.	 A new joint study by DPIIT and NCAER54 estimates logistics costs at 7.97 per 
cent of GDP for FY24, which is lower than 8.84 and 8.79 per cent for FY23 and FY22, 
respectively. This indicates that initiatives like PM GatiShakti, Dedicated Freight 
Corridors (DFC), Bharatmala, and Sagarmala are already driving significant cost 
optimisation and efficiency gains. Collectively, these developments are thus building 
a more predictable and cost-competitive industrial environment, which will help India 
better integrate into GVCs.  Further details on initiatives in the infrastructure sub-
sectors leading to logistics improvements are presented in the infrastructure chapter 
(Chapter 9).
Box VIII.9: Why India must strengthen its industrial 
cluster strategy to compete globally
India’s ambition to emerge as a globally competitive industrial hub will critically depend on 
the strength and scale of its industrial clusters. Evidence from across the world shows that 
high-performing clusters are not just contributors to industrial activity; they are central to 
a nation’s export growth, attracting foreign investment, driving innovation and enhancing 
productivity. Countries that have successfully integrated into GVCs, starting from China, 
Vietnam to South Korea, all have done so through a small number of highly competitive, 
globally connected clusters that combine economic density with institutional agility. China’s 
Greater Bay Area, for example, generates 35 per cent of national exports and 11 per cent 
of GDP while occupying less than 1 per cent of land. Vietnam’s two key economic regions 
contribute nearly two-thirds of GDP and trade within just 11 per cent of its land area. 
These examples highlight a consistent pattern: industrial activity needs concentration, 
connectivity, and a local environment that grants the freedom to compete and innovate.55
Industrial clusters create advantages by bringing firms, suppliers, workers, and logistics 
together in dense ecosystems. Such co-location increases productivity through shared 
infrastructure, reduced transaction costs, common labour pools, and continual knowledge 
spillovers—all of which are essential to industrial competitiveness. A recent success story is 
Nashik’s luggage ecosystem, where Samsonite’s facility has emerged as the world’s largest 
by volume, surpassing long-standing European hubs.56 The company’s decision to further 
expand locally highlights the importance of established regional supply chains and workforce 
stability. Such examples demonstrate the potential to ‘Make in India for India and the world’ 
by evolving regional clusters into high-productivity global manufacturing bases.

India has also attempted to build industrial clusters through various schemes over the past 
few decades, from the 1997 Industrial Park Scheme and the 2005 SEZ Act to the National 
Industrial Corridor Development Programme and sector-specific clusters for electronics, 
textiles, and software. While India has several organically developed clusters that bolster 
domestic production, however, transforming these clusters into globally competitive 
ecosystems requires addressing two key structural factors. First, achieving optimal scale: 
the median size of India’s clusters is relatively small, often lacking the necessary land area 
and robust multimodal connectivity essential for global value chain integration. Second, 
enhancing regulatory flexibility: frameworks governing these zones have yet to fully relax 
key constraints related to labour, building norms, and ease of doing business, which limit 
their appeal to international firms seeking speed and predictability.
The gap between domestic strength and global competitiveness underscores the need for 
an upgraded cluster strategy. Strengthening India’s global competitiveness requires re-
imagining the cluster model as a high-productivity, reform-enabled ecosystem. The strategic 
way forward can be built on three pillars. First, it should prioritise scale and location by 
strategically identifying and anchoring large, high-potential regions in well-connected 
brownfield locations, ensuring the necessary scale through clear land titling and modern 
land pooling mechanisms. Second, an empowered institutional mechanism (like the IFSCA 
at GIFT City) can be granted the authority to ensure regulatory certainty and flexibility, 
enabling clusters to operate with globally competitive speed. Third, it should involve 
harnessing private execution by enhancing the role of private developers to masterplan, 
build, and operate core infrastructure, ensuring market responsiveness and efficiency. 
Clusters designed under this framework may have the potential to become India’s primary 
engines of growth, accelerating integration into global value chains and supporting the 
nation's economic growth and resilience.
8.58.	 Manufacturing activity in India is expanding beyond metropolitan cities to Tier-
2 and Tier-3 cities, which possess advantages such as affordable land, lower real estate 
and wage costs, and proximity to raw material sources. These cities offer significant 
potential for job creation, sustained economic growth and improved livelihoods, 
while also supporting decongestion of large metro cities. Sustained investments in 
connectivity, industrial infrastructure, skilling and supportive policy frameworks can 
further facilitate many Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities to emerge as competitive manufacturing 
centers not just domestically but also globally.
8.59.	 Case studies from smaller industrial centers of Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities illustrate 
how these advantages are translating into manufacturing competitiveness. For instance, 
Hubballi-Dharwad-Belagavi is an emerging cluster for advanced manufacturing.57 In 
Belagavi (Karnataka), long-standing foundry and precision-engineering capabilities 
have evolved into an aerospace-oriented cluster supplying castings and machined 
components to domestic and global manufacturers, supported by local skills and cluster-

based industrial development. Similarly, with lower operating costs and improved 
road, rail and air connectivity with wider supply chains - a diversified manufacturing 
base anchored in steel processing, metal fabrication and consumer durables has 
been developed at Hubballi–Dharwad.58  India’s industrial future thus is likely to be 
facilitated by its smaller cities across various states.
SCALING UP MSMEs: DEEPENING COMPETITIVENESS, 
EXPANDING MARKET ACCESS, AND BRIDGING THE CREDIT 
GAP
8.60.	 Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of India’s 
industrial economy, accounting for approximately 35.4 per cent of manufacturing, 
around 48.58 per cent of exports, and 31.1 per cent of GDP in the country.59  With 
over 7.47 crore enterprises employing over 32.82 crore persons,60 the sector holds 
its position as the second-largest employer after agriculture. Globally, MSMEs make 
up about 90 per cent of businesses and are responsible for over 50 per cent of the 
total global employment.61 With India’s manufacturing sector positioned for greater 
global integration, MSME sector’s role is critical in enabling effective supply-chain 
participation, fostering local value addition, and supporting inclusive regional growth. 
8.61.	 Despite expanding credit footprints and rising digital integration, access to 
formal credit remains a binding constraint for many micro-enterprises due to limited 
collateral and documentation readiness, as is generally the case worldwide. This 
challenge was also highlighted in the World Bank’s Financial Sector Assessment Report 
for India (2025),62 which noted that 27 per cent of MSMEs identify finance as their 
biggest obstacle. Women-owned MSMEs, in particular, account for a small fraction of 
commercial credit, though formalisation under Udyam and targeted credit guidelines 
are gradually addressing this gap. Furthermore, MSME credit has maintained a positive 
trajectory in recent times, bolstered by several government interventions aimed at 
enhancing credit flow to the sector.
8.62.	 MSME credit remained the primary driver of industrial credit growth during 
H1FY26. In recent periods, the overall MSME credit growth year-on-year (Y-o-Y)

has significantly outpaced the Y-o-Y growth observed in large industry credit (Table 
VIII.3).63 This acceleration can partly be attributed to policy measures, including the 
revised MSME classification thresholds implemented in April 2025, which expanded 
the eligibility for priority sector lending, guidelines enabling jewellery-backed small 
business loans and targeted Budget schemes. Further, NBFCs continued to play a critical 
role as last-mile credit providers, maintaining strong double-digit lending growth to 
MSMEs.64

with professional fund management to provide crucial early-stage and growth-stage support 
to MSMEs. The Fund invests in companies through various instruments, including equity 
or equity-linked investments, convertible instruments, and debentures, to achieve risk-
adjusted returns.67 
The Fund has attracted significant private capital into high-technology MSMEs through co-
investment and risk-sharing mechanisms and supported MSMEs in acquiring vital defence 
certifications, facilitating vendor development processes, and achieving their export 
readiness. The initiative is explicitly aligned with the national indigenisation priorities 
outlined under the Defence Production and Export Promotion Policy (DPEPP). It leverages 
strong linkages to Maharashtra’s established industrial corridors and emerging defence 
clusters.
The Fund has extended capital support to a broad set of MSMEs, with investments spanning 
missile systems, aerospace technologies, naval platforms, and electronic warfare. It has 
built a diversified portfolio, including investments across multiple enterprises and selective 
full and partial exits, reflecting a maturing investment cycle. This Fund demonstrates how 
State-level innovation finance can accelerate MSME technological capabilities in sunrise 
sectors. Such funds can indeed accelerate MSME participation in strategic value chains by 
catalysing private investment, facilitating certification and R&D and anchoring enterprises 
within emerging industrial corridors.
8.64.	 To strengthen credit linkages, the Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) for Micro

enhancements include increasing the extent of guarantee coverage for women-owned 
MSEs from 85 per cent to 90 per cent. Additionally, effective from 01 April 2025, the 
government has doubled the ceiling for guarantee coverage from ₹5 crore to ₹10 crore 
and rationalised the annual guarantee fee for coverage exceeding ₹1 crore. 68

component, which facilitates incubation, design interventions, and the protection of

8.66.	 Operational challenges such as delayed payments affect liquidity, especially for 
micro-suppliers. With a view to address these challenges, government’s noteworthy 
interventions include expanding TReDS (Trade Receivables Discounting System) 
ecosystem and digital invoicing with a reduced monetary limit for onboarding on 
TReDS for Corporates and CPSEs  from ₹500 crore to a turnover of ₹250 crore,70 the 
rapid progress of the ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) ecosystem and the 
TEAM (Trade Enablement and Marketing Scheme) Initiative (which aims to assist 
five lakh MSMEs to onboard the platform)71 offer a transformative path for MSMEs to 
integrate into formal e-commerce and supply chains at lower transaction costs.
Box VIII.11: Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) for MSMEs: 
Securing Working Capital
The persistence of delayed payments remains a critical challenge for the MSME sector, 
with an estimated ₹8.1 lakh crore locked in delayed payments72, impacting working capital 
and restricting growth. When an MSME files a delayed payment case against a buyer, it 
may strain or even damage the business relationship. Buyers may perceive the filing as an 
adversarial step and may stop placing new orders or discontinue the partnership altogether. 
Since MSMEs rely heavily on long-term commercial ties, the fear of losing future business 
prevent them from pursuing legal option, even when large dues remain pending.
The MSE Scheme on Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) for Delayed Payments, along with 
the MSME ODR Portal developed under it, introduces a structured process that encourages 
amicable settlement between seller and buyer before the dispute moves into formal 
adjudication under the MSMED Act, 2006. This early, dialogue-based resolution mechanism 
allows MSMEs to recover delayed payments without undermining business relationships.
The portal is designed for accessibility, featuring an end-to-end digital process that is 
faster and more cost-effective than traditional channels. Its low-cost structure, multi-
layered resolution mechanism (combining negotiation, conciliation, and arbitration), and 
24X7 availability in multiple languages make dispute resolution economically viable even 
for very small claims. Ultimately, the ODR initiative enhances trust, promotes contractual 
discipline, and can directly ease the cash-flow stress that plagues the MSME ecosystem, 
ensuring greater resilience and competitiveness.
8.67.	 Overall, the MSME sector is well-positioned to harness the current momentum 
in the manufacturing sector. In order to continue the momentum, innovative measures

including cash-flow–based lending should be expanded significantly to encourage 
formal credit access to micro and even first-time borrowers. Further, accelerating 
digital lending partnerships may also channel timely and affordable finance to a wider 
base of enterprises.
Box VIII.12: Strengthening Access to Small-Value Credit– Financing 
Opportunities for Unincorporated Manufacturing Enterprises
Adequate and timely access to credit continues to be a critical enabler of growth for the 
unincorporated sector. In recent years, access to finance for unincorporated enterprises 
has improved considerably. According to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector 
Enterprises (ASUSE), the average outstanding loan per unincorporated non-agricultural 
establishment increased from ₹50,138 in 2022–23 to ₹53,710 in 2023–24, reflecting a 
growth of 7.12 per cent.
This expansion in credit availability has also been accompanied by a gradual shift towards 
formal financing channels, which is a welcome trend. The share of unincorporated 
manufacturing establishments accessing formal sources of credit rose from 48 per cent in 
2021–22 to 51 per cent in 2023–24. Chart VIII.26 further illustrates this transition, showing 
a 6-percentage-point increase in borrowing from commercial banks between 2021–22 and 
2023–24, alongside a 3-percentage-point decline each in reliance on informal lenders. These 
developments have been possible due to sustained Government efforts to broaden financial 
inclusion and strengthen the MSME credit ecosystem. Initiatives such as the Pradhan 
Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, credit guarantee frameworks, interest subvention schemes, and 
the MUDRA Yojana have played a significant role in expanding banking outreach and 
improving access to formal credit for unincorporated enterprises.

Further, this shift towards formal sources has also helped reduce the interest burden 
(measured as interest payable during the reference period as a proportion of outstanding 
loans) for establishments. As shown in Chart VIII.27, loans obtained from formal institutions 
typically carry a lower interest burden than those from informal sources. This pattern largely 
holds true even for small-ticket loans (loan amount less than ₹50,000), except in the case 
of commercial banks, where the interest burden may be comparable to that of informal 
lenders, reflecting pricing adjustments for higher perceived risk and lower profitability in 
such segments. Friends continue to serve as an important financing source owing to strong 
personal relationships and the availability of low- or zero-interest loans without collateral, 
particularly for small and urgent funding needs.

Chart VIII.28 offers further insights into opportunities for strengthening access to formal 
finance. While formal institutions have been effective in reducing dependence on informal 
channels for moderate- and large-sized loan requirements, there is scope for improvement 
in the provision of formal finance for small-ticket loans. On the demand side, micro and 
small enterprises often seek small working-capital loans but face barriers such as limited 
documentation, weak or thin credit histories, the absence of formal banking relationships, 
and low levels of financial literacy.  On the supply side, formal lenders face disincentives 
in serving this segment due to low profit margins, high transaction and monitoring costs, 
heightened risk perceptions, and credit products that are often not tailored to the operational 
needs of these enterprises. Consequently, enterprises continue to rely on informal sources 
despite their relatively higher costs.73

INTEGRATING WITH GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS
8.68.	 India accounted for an estimated 2.9 per cent of the global manufacturing GVA78 
and 1.8 per cent of global merchandise exports in 2024,79 indicating considerable 
potential for expanding its global manufacturing footprint. The limited share can be 
attributed to relatively low participation in GVC trade, particularly on the backward-
linked side, where firms import intermediates and components to assemble for export. 
8.69.	 This trend calls for reviewing our policy approach: should India prioritise 
deepening domestic sourcing or focus on integrating more actively with international 
production networks? Research supports the latter for a labour-rich economy like 
India. While greater integration into GVCs, especially through backward participation 
(importing inputs), initially raises the share of Foreign Value Added (FVA), it generates 
significantly higher absolute Domestic Value-Added (DVA) and employment in the 
medium term due to scale effects (Grossman & Rossi-Hansberg, 2008).  For a labour-
rich economy, export-oriented GVC participation can be a powerful mechanism for 
employment generation in higher-productivity manufacturing. 
8.70.	 Recent geopolitical realignments and global supply-chain restructuring can 
also create opportunities for labour-abundant economies to position themselves as 
competitive assembly and manufacturing hubs in GVCs. In this context, higher import 
tariffs on intermediates and capital goods relative to final products can lead to inverted 
duty structures, which raise input costs for domestic manufacturers and discourage 
assembly and component manufacturing. A renewed and sustained focus on input 
tariff neutrality may therefore help realise the potential in this window. Towards 
this end, recent budgets have already initiated correction of inverted duty structures, 
particularly in several core manufacturing sectors, contributing to a more neutral tariff 
environment. Going forward, continued calibration of tariffs on intermediates and 
capital goods—especially in high-growth sectors—can enhance cost competitiveness, 
deepen assembly and component ecosystems, and support India’s emergence as a 
preferred global production base.
Box VIII.13: Backward GVC participation and Domestic Value Addition: 
Evidence from India and Vietnam
GVC integration occurs through two principal channels: (i) backward linkages, wherein 
firms import intermediate inputs for processing and export of final goods, and (ii) forward 
linkages, where domestically produced inputs are exported for further processing abroad. 
For late-industrialising economies, empirical literature suggests that backward GVC 
participation often generates relatively larger early-stage gains, by facilitating entry into

assembly-based activities, enabling rapid scale expansion, and supporting employment 
growth in labour-intensive segments of production (Veeramani & Dhir, 2022).80
In the period following trade liberalisation in the 1990s, India experienced a notable 
increase in backward GVC integration. The BVAX ratio81  — measured as the share of foreign 
value added in gross exports — rose from 10.7 per cent in 1995 to 25.5 per cent in 2012, 
before moderating to 17.2 per cent in 2020. Over a comparable period, Vietnam’s BVAX 
ratio increased more sharply, reaching close to 48 per cent, underpinned by sustained tariff 
liberalisation, an explicitly export-oriented industrial policy, and deeper integration into 
global production networks.82

Cross-country and sectoral evidence indicates that higher backward participation can 
contribute to increases in total domestic value added (DVA), even when the domestic share 
per unit of export remains modest in the initial stages. In electronics, for example, Vietnam’s 
BVAX in 2020 was approximately 49.8 per cent — nearly twice India’s 25.4 per cent — yet 
Vietnam generated greater absolute DVA and export value, reflecting the role of scale effects 
in amplifying domestic value creation. Similar patterns are observed in textiles and related 
sectors, where Vietnam’s stronger GVC integration has been associated with significantly 
higher export volumes.
These trends suggest that, when supported by competitive input tariffs, efficient logistics 
and customs processes, predictable regulatory regimes, and an investment-conducive 
ecosystem, backward-linked GVC integration can function as an important pathway for 
export growth, employment generation, and gradual strengthening of domestic productive 
capabilities.

For India, a calibrated deepening of participation in global supply chains — particularly in 
labour-intensive and assembly-linked sectors — represents a potential avenue for advancing 
job-rich industrialisation within the broader Viksit Bharat@2047 growth trajectory.
Box VIII.14: Why Advanced Manufacturing Matters for India
Advanced manufacturing strategy based on R&D intensive, innovative technology to 
improve and enhance competitiveness, can contribute not only as a driver of growth, but 
as a comprehensive ecosystem for enforcing systemic discipline at scale, in a big and late-
industrialising economy such as India. Full exposure to global competition, uncompromising 
quality standards along with thin margins with dynamic delivery standards, significantly 
limits the scope for regulatory discretion or political access. It would thus encourage 
manufacturing sector automatically to strictly avoid any compromise on productivity, 
reliability, and scale. This distinguishes advanced manufacturing from other growth 
pathways that may raise output without altering firm behaviour. This is also very much 
in line with India’s manufacturing policy based on strategic, selective, and mission-driven, 
rather than neutral, passive, or purely incentive-based. 
The integration of advanced manufacturing with logistics, power, ports, standards, 
and skills ensures that any institutional weaknesses or deviation quickly and invariably 
translate into huge economic costs – compelling both the industry or regulator/government 
to strengthen the weakness or to incur losses or face consequences of poor execution. 
International experience from Germany, Japan, and South Korea shows that sustained 
engagement in advanced manufacturing exports has supported both firm-level upgradation 
and improvements in state capacity.
While not sufficient for inclusive growth and not without risks, it has been observed that the 
advanced manufacturing remains the pathway that disciplines firms, constrains discretion, 
and compels governance upgradation at the system level. Other growth drivers—such as 
infrastructure, capital markets, digital governance, and services exports—can raise incomes, 
but function best as complements rather than substitutes. Advanced manufacturing matters 
not because it is aspirational, but because its unforgiving nature forces capability and efficiency 
at scale on a sustained basis. India’s national manufacturing mission strategy in the context 
of economic development, geopolitical uncertainty, technological disruption, and strategic 
autonomy can thus accommodate the advanced manufacturing without any frictions.
CONCLUSION: A ROADMAP FOR THE NEXT LEAP
8.71.	 India’s industrial sector continues to display strong momentum despite an 
evolving and challenging global environment, supported by reforms in infrastructure, 
logistics, ease of doing business and innovation systems. The rise of medium and 
high-technology manufacturing, growing traction under PLI schemes, and improving 
business sentiment point to a strengthening production ecosystem. Domestic

fundraising and credit access have diversified, corporate balance sheets are healthier, 
and MSMEs are increasingly being integrated into formal supply chains, also through 
digital platforms and cluster development. India’s industrial path is unfolding at a time 
when the global economy is marked by supply-chain realignments, near-shoring and 
friend-shoring impulses, and a more fragmented global order. As highlighted in the 
Economic Survey 2024–25, India must rely more on domestic engines of growth, and 
this moment represents an inflexion point.
8.72.	 The next phase of industrialisation will require a calibrated shift from a model 
centred mainly on import substitution towards one focused on scale, competitiveness, 
innovation and deeper integration into GVCs. Rather than seeking complete self-reliance 
in every segment, India needs to build strategic resilience through diversification and 
creating depth of capabilities. This requires an increase in private sector investment in 
R&D, technology adoption, skills, and quality systems. MSMEs will be crucial in this 
journey, evolving from micro-scale production toward deeper participation in formal 
and export-linked supply chains [See Box VIII.15]. 
Box VIII.15: Innovation for Strategic Resilience and Indispensability
The global economy has transitioned from an era of efficiency-driven globalisation to one 
defined by strategic resilience and technological sovereignty. In this landscape, the ability 
to innovate is no longer merely a driver of productivity; it has become the primary currency 
of national security and geopolitical leverage.
Despite being the world's fourth-largest economy, India’s Gross Expenditure on R&D 
remains stagnant at ~0.64 per cent of GDP, significantly trailing the 2.5 per cent–5 per cent 
range of innovation-led economies like the US, China, and Israel. The deficiency in India 
is not a lack of scientific talent but challenges in collaboration with the private sector and 
‘translation’ at scale. 
India excels at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 1-3, but an industrial economy needs 
TRL 7-9 products. The intermediate stage - prototyping, piloting, and characterisation - 
constitutes the stage at which Indian innovation appears to stagnate. To secure a position of 
leverage in global supply chains, India must continue to work towards bridging the critical 
gap between academic discovery and industrial commercialisation. Innovation reforms 
in India must be holistic and systemic, addressing not only research funding but also 
translation, adoption, and scale. 
A critical diagnosis of the Indian ecosystem reveals a persistent market failure where the 
Indian private sector, historically risk-averse and comfortable with technology licensing or 
import, has failed to step up as the primary engine of R&D. In this context, the announcement 
of ₹1 lakh crore RDI Scheme and its operationalization by the Hon’ble Prime Minister in 
November 2025, reflects a sincere commitment from GOI to collaborate with and incentivize 
the private sector to undertake innovation and help catapult India towards the frontiers of 
research, development and innovation.

Economic Survey 2025-26
336

As we undertake this policy effort to place innovation as a core anchor for India’s journey 
going forward, there is a case for examining the need to complement the approach through 
the creation of Translational Research Centres (TRCs) that serve as shared national assets 
for piloting and prototyping. TRCs can be viewed as essential national infrastructure, 
comparable to physical and digital public infrastructure, and can help reduce the cost and 
risk of testing, validating, and scaling new technologies for start-ups, MSMEs, industry, 
and academic institutions. By being built and managed as long-term national assets rather 
than short-term projects, these centres can provide shared access, continuity, and lasting 
impact across multiple technology cycles. The ANRF architecture can be leveraged for the 
identification, establishment, and governance of such TRCs as critical national infrastructure. 
The effectiveness of India’s innovation reforms depends on adopting a balanced, system-
wide approach across the science and technology ecosystem, supported by robust governance 
frameworks, clear performance metrics, and transparent delivery and accountability 
mechanisms. In this context, it is essential that the ANRF and the RDI Scheme operate 
in close coordination to align demand signals, research priorities, institutional incentives, 
standards-setting, and public procurement. Such alignment will enable the creation of a 
coherent and integrated national research-to-deployment pipeline, ensuring efficient 
translation of research outcomes into scalable and deployable technologies.
The data from ASPI's critical technology tracker is a wake-up call – the global technology 
landscape is bifurcating, and India cannot afford to be a client state. Global capital flows are 
increasingly gravitating along ‘geopolitical faultlines.’ Countries that control critical nodes 
—such as semiconductors, advanced materials, and APIs—possess ‘reverse leverage.’ 
If India fails to ignite this innovation engine, the risks would be long-lasting. India risks 
remaining a ‘service provider’ to the developed world, vulnerable to technology denial 
regimes and supply chain shocks. Conversely, India can choose to work towards the 
following objective: defensive sovereignty (preventing supply shocks) and offensive leverage 
(becoming indispensable in high-tech domains). A firm choice shall have to be made.
8.73.	 As India considers its manufacturing strategy amid economic transformation, 
geopolitical uncertainty and rapid technological change, manufacturing capacity needs 
to be viewed as a strategic national asset. It is central to employment, productivity, 
technological learning, exports and strategic resilience, and therefore warrants a 
mission-oriented approach beyond purely incentive-based interventions. In this context, 
government interventions may be considered even in the absence of immediate cost 
competitiveness for select sectors and technologies of national interest. Policy design 
can also benefit from treating industrial clusters, rather than standalone firms, as the 
unit of competition by integrating anchor firms, MSMEs, suppliers, skills, logistics and 
R&D, with an emphasis on ecosystem depth.
8.74.	 Sequenced capability building is also critical for strengthening manufacturing 
competitiveness. This involves supporting progression from assembly to components, 

Industry's Next Leap: Structural Transformation and Global Integration

337
systems and design- or IP-intensive activities through sector-specific capability ladders 
with time-bound milestones for localisation and value addition. Export performance 
can serve as an important test of competitiveness, with supported sectors transitioning 
from import substitution towards exports over defined timelines. While innovative 
experimentation and learning should be encouraged, persistent stagnation or continued 
support without capability growth should be avoided. Within this framework, the role 
of the State extends beyond facilitation to that of strategist, coordinator, risk absorber 
and capability builder, operating within a federal structure that encourages States also 
to act as co-owners of national manufacturing priorities aligned with local strengths.
8.75.	 Strengthening the enabling ecosystem will also be key. Continued tariff 
rationalisation, especially for intermediates and capital goods, can enhance cost 
competitiveness and deepen GVC integration. Modern logistics infrastructure, under 
the PM GatiShakti initiative, regulatory simplification, and a focused industrial cluster 
strategy—anchored in scale, supplier depth, skills, and shared infrastructure—will be 
vital for expanding manufacturing beyond existing enclaves,—especially in Tier–2 and 
Tier–3 cities.  The innovation push under ANRF and the RDI Fund, coupled with a 
future-ready workforce in semiconductors, EVs, green tech and advanced materials, 
will support technological upgradation. In this context, advanced manufacturing can 
play a critical role in raising productivity, strengthening export competitiveness and 
enforcing discipline across firms and create a revamped and robust manufacturing 
ecosystem.
8.76.	 Ultimately, a strong industrial sector is a strategic imperative for India. With 
sustained reform momentum, investment in innovation and human capital, and 
dynamic private sector participation, the industrial sector can emerge as a central pillar 
and contribute even more significantly in the journey towards Viksit Bharat@2047.

INVESTMENT AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE:  
STRENGTHENING CONNECTIVITY, 
CAPACITY AND COMPETITIVENESS
Infrastructure continues to be central to India’s growth strategy, with public 
capital expenditure following a sustained upward trajectory since FY15 and 
gaining further momentum in recent years. Large-scale investments across 
roads, railways, ports, power, aviation and digital infrastructure have 
strengthened connectivity, expanded capacity and improved logistics efficiency, 
generating strong multiplier effects for growth and productivity. This phase has 
been characterised not only by rapid asset creation but also by a shift towards 
integrated, system-level development.
A defining feature of this transition has been the institutionalisation of 
multimodal planning through PM GatiShakti, complemented by the National 
Logistics Policy and digital platforms that are reducing transaction costs and 
execution risks. Reforms in infrastructure financing—spanning project finance 
regulation, Public-Private Partnership (PPP) frameworks, asset monetisation 
and capital market instruments—are crowding-in private investment. At the 
same time, India’s infrastructure base is broadening to include digital public 
infrastructure (DPI), clean energy, resilient water systems and emerging 
sectors. Sustaining investment momentum while aligning infrastructure with 
efficiency, sustainability and competitiveness will continue to remain key 
towards supporting India’s medium-term growth and its long-term vision of 
Viksit Bharat @2047.
INTRODUCTION: INFRASTRUCTURE AS THE ENGINE OF 
GROWTH
9.1 	 The decisive role of infrastructure investment in India’s growth strategy has been a 
defining feature in recent years. Union Budget priorities since FY20 reflect a sustained 
shift toward large-scale public capital expenditure, supported by integrated planning, 
and the systemic modernisation of logistics and connectivity networks.
9.2 	 This period has been marked not just by the accelerated expansion of traditional 
infrastructure, such as highways, railways, ports, and energy systems, but also by the 
expansion of digital public infrastructure (DPI), data systems, and assets aligned with 
renewable energy. Together, these developments signal a shift in how India plans and 
finances infrastructure projects, moving beyond mere capacity addition to focusing on 
enhancing efficiency, competitiveness and network integration.

9.3 	 A major element of this shift has been the substantial increase in public capital 
expenditure. Between FY19 and FY22, the Government of India’s capital expenditure 
increased by 92 per cent, from ₹3.07 lakh crore to ₹5.92 lakh crore. This momentum has 
been sustained over the subsequent fiscal years, reinforcing the objective of expanding 
access to quality infrastructure across the country.
9.4 	 The Government of India’s capital outlay has increased by nearly 89 per cent, 
from ₹5.92 lakh crore in FY22 to a budgeted allocation of ₹11.21 lakh crore for FY26, 
recognising the strong multiplier effects that infrastructure generates on the economy. 
Public expenditure on infrastructure has a high multiplier effect, estimated by studies 
to be around 2.5 to 3.5 times the GDP over the medium term.1 This means, for every 
rupee spent by the government in creating infrastructure, GDP gains worth ₹2.5-₹3.5 
accrue.2 The scale and consistency of this investment momentum have positioned 
infrastructure as a cornerstone of India’s growth engine.

reforms designed to enhance planning quality and reduce execution risks also through 
private participation. The PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, launched in 2021, has

of PM GatiShakti Public has further democratised the platform, providing regulated
