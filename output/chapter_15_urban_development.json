  "summary": [
    "CITIZENS India’s cities shape how millions of people live, work, travel, and earn their livelihoods every day. They are engines of growth, magnets for talent, and crucibles of innovation. At the same time, they are sites of daily strain: long commutes, uneven services, and shared spaces that often fall short of collective expectations. This chapter argues that India’s urban story is therefore neither one of decline nor adequacy, but of unfinished promise.",
    "The central idea is simple: cities are not merely habitats; they are a form of critical economic infrastructure. Density and proximity power productivity, deepen labour markets, and enable learning. Yet the same forces that create dynamism also generate congestion, environmental stress, and institutional complexity. India is already deeply urban in economic terms, with the majority of its national output generated in cities and in urban areas. The task now is to make that urbanisation work better for citizens in tangible and intangible ways.",
    "Many urban pressures stem from persistent supply-side constraints in land, housing and mobility. Restricted density, unclear titles and limited land recycling constrain affordable housing, while transport systems remain overly reliant on private vehicles. Core services such as sanitation, waste, and water services have expanded markedly but must now evolve from expansion to reliability, circularity and efficiency. However, beneath these sectoral stresses lies a deeper institutional issue: fragmented metropolitan governance and limited fiscal autonomy for cities – to plan, finance and deliver at scale.",
    "Beyond infrastructure, there is a need to improve the intangible foundations of urban life, such as civic norms, shared responsibility, and respect for public spaces. As Elinor Ostrom's work on the commons reminds us, shared spaces and services depend as much on norms, trust, and collective behaviour as on formal rules. Similarly, Indian economic thought echoes this insight:D. R. Gadgil argued that development outcomes are ultimately shaped by institutions and social organisation, not investment alone. The quality of urban experience depends as much on collective behaviour as on budgets and bridges. Strengthening civic consciousness, alongside better institutions, is essential to creating cities that feel not only efficient but also welcoming.",
    "Across all these themes runs a common optimism: India’s cities can work better for their citizens. If planning, finance, and governance align around people- centric outcomes, India’s cities can move from managing growth to truly benefiting from it, turning urbanisation into a visible source of opportunity, well-being and everyday ease for citizens."

Metro rail, flyovers, and expressways are built without parallel land-use reform, housing supply, or skill clustering. Transport systems are asked to compensate for planning failures rather than enable density. The result is capital-intensive infrastructure with sub- optimal economic returns.

This distortion raises land values and creates artificial scarcity in core urban areas. Compared to global cities like New York and Hong Kong, India’s cities have relatively lower FSI, with exceptions for denser areas such as central business districts. When the FSI is low, settlements are incentivised to expand horizontally, driving up average land cost and increasing infrastructure delivery costs per unit of housing or commercial space. This limits housing supply and raises prices relative to incomes."

This left streets and gated communities littered with uncollected waste and rising public health risks. In many neighbourhoods, residents were forced to organise their own waste pickup or hire ad-hoc vehicles in the absence of trained crews. What had been routine, invisible work suddenly became impossible to overlook, underscoring how the smooth functioning of urban systems depends on a labour force that has no formal visibility yet is structurally indispensable. The disruption extended beyond sanitation, with domestic helpers, cooks and other informal service providers also leaving, leading households to scramble for alternatives and pay sharply higher rates. This episode illustrated that informal labour is not a peripheral or expendable sector but a foundational component of everyday urban life, whose absence can quickly translate into deterioration of services and elevated transaction costs for residents and local governments alike.

Moving forward, we need urban infrastructure that is integrated, people-centred and productivity-enhancing rather than fragmented and asset-driven. For e.g., Metro divorced from ToD (Transit-oriented Development) principles, stands as an engineering project rather than a city-shaping project. Station areas remain low-density, poorly connected, and constrained by rigid zoning, resulting in under-utilised capacity, weak farebox recovery, and limited impact on overall urban mobility, unlike global examples where metro stations anchor dense, mixed-use neighbourhoods that maximise ridership, shorten commutes, raise land values, and generate revenues to sustain the system. Efforts must be made to reduce the project- system mismatch to build integrated systems. Road expansion must be paired with effective parking management, pedestrian infrastructure, and prioritisation of public transport. Flyovers should give way to network-level traffic management and junction redesign. Additionally, drainage upgrades must be planned at the city scale, linked to natural water flows and land use patterns. Institutionally, this requires aligning planning, finance, and execution under a single urban or metropolitan authority, with clear incentives for coordination across sectors. Shifting the focus from asset delivery to system performance is essential if infrastructure investment is to translate into meaningful and sustained improvements in urban outcomes."

After a decade of quantitative easing and steadily declining nominal and real interest rates, monetary policy, he argued, was losing traction in stimulating productive investment, with liquidity instead flowing into interest-rate- sensitive and safe-haven assets, inflating asset prices and compressing real yields — a dynamic he termed the “QE Infinity Trap”, in which economies become dependent on sustained accommodation merely to preserve activity. Several elements of this prognosis are now visible: financial repression and negative real yields have unfolded in much of the developed world, while geopolitical tensions, trade frictions and conflict have contributed to a more uncertain and fragile global environment. With that, the world has entered a period of uncertainty, unpredictability and danger.
