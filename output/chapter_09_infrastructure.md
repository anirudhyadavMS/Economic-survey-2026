access to geospatial data for private developers and researchers to leverage advanced 
analytics for infrastructure planning and investment decisions.3
9.6 Complementary initiatives under the National Logistics Policy (NLP) have 
supported the emergence of a more predictable and digitised logistics environment. 
The use of the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) and the insights drawn from 
the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) framework are actively improving 
logistics efficiency, which directly affects the competitiveness of India's manufacturing 
sector. A detailed analysis of the impact of the PM GatiShakti framework, the National 
Logistics Policy, and other initiatives aimed at reducing logistics costs and improving 
competitiveness is presented in the Infrastructure and Logistics section in Chapter 8 
on Industry.
9.7 	 Beyond physical assets, DPI acts as an essential force multiplier across the economy. 
The expansion of BharatNet, the deployment of 5G networks, and the continued growth 
of platforms like Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and Aadhaar, ULIP, DigiYatra, 
FASTag, form the essential digital backbone upon which smart, efficient, and inclusive 
infrastructure services are delivered at scale.
9.8 	 Overall, infrastructure remains a key lever for sustaining medium-term growth 
through (i) continued public capex and improved project planning and execution, (ii) 
crowding-in of private investment through a stronger Public-Private Partnership (PPP) 
pipeline, (iii) deeper and more resilient long-term financing via capital markets and 
prudentially sound bank/NBFC credit.
9.9 	 While public capital expenditure on infrastructure has expanded significantly in 
recent years, its effectiveness increasingly depends on the quality of project planning, 
prioritisation and execution. Evidence from various studies suggests that time and 
cost overruns in large infrastructure projects are often linked to gaps in upstream 
project preparation, including weak feasibility assessments, incomplete Detailed 
Project Reports (DPRs), rigid procurement practices, and delays in dispute resolution. 
Strengthening institutional capacity across the project lifecycle, including improved 
project preparation, lifecycle-based costing, standardised contracts, faster dispute 
resolution, wider adoption of technology, and skill development are critical to delivering 
infrastructure faster, at scale, and within budget.  
9.10 	 The subsequent sections of this chapter discuss measures to enhance 
infrastructure financing and provide a detailed review of progress, outlook, 
and challenges across key infrastructure sub-sectors, including core physical 
infrastructure, energy sector, digital infrastructure, rural infrastructure and emerging

sectors infrastructure. Discussions pertaining to urban infrastructure and social 
infrastructures, such as health and education, are covered separately in Chapters 15 
and 11, respectively.
ENHANCING INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING AND PRIVATE 
PARTICIPATION
9.11 		 India’s infrastructure financing landscape is undergoing a change and shifting 
from a historical dependence on bank credit toward a diversified ecosystem of 
alternative financing vehicles and capital market instruments. While bank credit to the 
infrastructure sector recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 4.6 per cent in October 
2025, recovering from 2.3 per cent YoY growth in October 2024, the incremental 
expansion of financing is increasingly being driven by non-bank channels.
9.12 		 Credit flows from non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) (net of bank 
borrowings), to the commercial sector grew at a robust compound annual growth rate 
(CAGR) of 43.3 per cent during FY20 to FY25, significantly outpacing the 25 per cent 
CAGR recorded for non-food bank credit over the same period.4 This evolving landscape 
has been further strengthened by the growing role of Infrastructure Investment Trusts 
(InvITs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which are enabling long-term 
institutional capital to participate in infrastructure assets (Chart IX.3). Together, 
these developments are helping to mitigate systemic risks by reducing asset–liability 
mismatches on bank balance sheets, while enhancing the sustainability of financing for 
long-gestation infrastructure projects.

9.13 		 A major regulatory milestone in infrastructure credit is the RBI (Project Finance) 
Directions 2025, effective from 01 October 2025. These guidelines introduce a unified 
framework for project lending across all financial institutions, ensuring a consistent 
approach to large-scale financing. A key feature of these directions is the revised 
treatment of the Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations (DCCO). This 
provides a more realistic way to handle project delays, which helps in better identifying 
actual stress and preventing the artificial ‘evergreening’ of loans. Furthermore, by 
aligning the definition of the ‘Infrastructure Sector’ with the government’s Harmonised 
Master List (HML) of infrastructure sub-sectors, the RBI has ensured regulatory clarity 
and policy synchronisation across the entire financial ecosystem. 
9.14 	 Capital-market channels for long-term funding and asset recycling have also 
been strengthened through incremental reforms. SEBI’s Small and Medium Real 
Estate Investment Trusts (SM REIT) framework reduced the minimum asset size 
relative to existing REITs, from ₹500 crore to ₹50 crore. It also introduced a scheme-
based structure, allowing multiple schemes to be managed under one SM REIT. Each 
scheme’s proposed assets are generally required to be at least ₹50 crore and less than 
₹500 crore. This broadens the universe of monetizable real estate assets and can 
support urban regeneration/commercial infrastructure by bringing smaller, stabilised 
assets into a regulated pooled vehicle.
9.15 		 Additionally, SEBI has decided that from 01 January 2026, investments by 
Mutual Funds and Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) in REITs will be treated as 
equity-related instruments, which is expected to ease participation constraints and 
potentially improve secondary market liquidity. From April to November 2025, ₹13,893 
crore was raised by listed Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure 
Investment Trusts (InvITs).5
Public-Private Partnerships
9.16 	 PPPs are vital mechanisms through which governments can leverage private 
sector expertise and resources to address critical infrastructure needs. They play a 
significant role in bridging infrastructure gaps and enhancing the efficiency of service 
delivery. The success of PPPs is largely dependent on the robustness of institutional 
frameworks, financial support, and the adoption of standardised documents, such as 
the Model Request for Qualification (RfQ), Model Request for Proposal (RfP), and 
Model Concession Agreements (MCAs). 
9.17 		 India’s infrastructure programs support a variety of PPP models, including

management contracts like Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Design-Build-Finance-
Operate-Transfer (DBFOT), Hybrid Annuity Model (HAM), and Toll-Operate-Transfer 
(TOT). Within the BOT framework, two variants exist—BOT (Toll) and BOT (Annuity)—
distinguished by the allocation of traffic risk. 
9.18 	 According to the World Bank’s Private Participation in Infrastructure (PPI) Report 
2024,6 India has consistently ranked among the top five countries globally in terms of 
private investment in infrastructure among low- and middle-income economies. India 
also emerged as the largest recipient of PPI investment in South Asia, accounting for 
over 90 per cent of the region’s total private infrastructure investment. This strong 
global standing is reflected domestically in the marked increase in project approvals by 
the Public-Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC), as illustrated in Chart 
IX.4. The key institutional and policy mechanisms underpinning India’s PPP framework 
are discussed in Box IX.1, while the priorities shaping its next phase are outlined in

Box IX.2: Public–Private Partnerships (PPP)- Strengthening 
the Partnership Paradigm
India’s PPP programme has traversed a full learning curve since the first wave of projects 
in the early 2000s. In the initial phase, multiple PPP models were tested across sectors, 
with some projects encountering stress or failure. These experiences informed successive 
improvements in model concession agreements, policy guidelines, and institutional practices 
by addressing contractual weaknesses, risk-allocation errors, and regulatory gaps. Over 
time, this iterative process has converted early experimentation into codified frameworks 
and institutional memory.
As a result, the environment for private participation in infrastructure is materially stronger 
in select core sectors. Roads, ports, power, and renewable energy now attract sustained 
private capital, supported by more stable policy regimes, standardised contracts, and 
clearer regulatory architectures. These sectors have transitioned from infancy to relative 
maturity through deliberate sequencing of reforms. For instance, tariff regulation in ports 
was initially institutionalised through the Tariff Authority for Major Ports (TAMP) and 
subsequently withdrawn as market depth and competition improved, underscoring the 
need for regulation to evolve with sector maturity.
The next challenge is to extend this maturity to a new generation of PPPs in emerging 
and socially critical sectors such as health, education, warehousing, sanitation, urban 
infrastructure, green hydrogen, and the broader energy transition. In these areas, 
conventional concession-style risk transfer is often insufficient. PPPs must increasingly 
reflect the third “P” — Partnership — where public and private actors co-design projects, 
share early-stage risks, and align incentives around long-term service outcomes rather than 
narrow financial closure.
Accordingly, India’s PPP framework needs to move from transaction-centric execution 
toward system-level market building, with a sharper focus on reducing structural uncertainty. 
This requires clearer sectoral pipelines with multi-year visibility, a tighter linkage between 
national programmes (PM GatiShakti, National Infrastructure Pipeline, sector missions), 
and bankable project preparation, as well as disciplined pre-construction risk closure by 
the public authority. PPP outcomes have been weakest where land acquisition, statutory 
clearances, demand assessment, or utility shifting have remained unresolved. In the coming 
decade, a credible PPP regime will be defined less by risk transfer on paper and more by the 
State’s capacity to absorb early-stage risks that private capital cannot efficiently price.
While PPP frameworks have matured at the central level and in select sectors, challenges 
persist at the sub-national level. The distinction between PPPs and Engineering Procurement 
and Construction (EPC) contracts—namely that PPPs are partnerships rather than vendor 
arrangements—is not always fully understood. Trust deficits and a limited understanding 
of risk–reward principles continue to constrain the uptake of PPPs in several states and 
urban local bodies. These challenges are compounded by uneven institutional capacity, even 
as states and cities account for a rising share of infrastructure demand. The next reform 
frontier lies in professionalising PPP cells, adopting programmatic approaches instead of 
project-by-project experimentation, and leveraging data platforms to track performance, 
renegotiation, and lifecycle outcomes. In this context, the Department of Economic Affairs’

schemes such as the India Infrastructure Project Development Fund (IIPDF) and Viability 
Gap Funding (VGF) are important.
An often-overlooked aspect relates to public perception. PPPs are sometimes perceived as 
‘selling of assets’ rather than long-term service partnerships, particularly at the state level. 
Improving communication and transparency is therefore important for sustaining public 
acceptance and investor confidence, especially for projects with long concession periods. 
The perception principle has improved by a long margin among central projects as compared 
with States. The lesson is often lost that wrong signalling in this regard creates two problems 
– adversely affecting the public mood and driving away investors willing to stomach the 
entirety of risks across a long concession period (30-60 years).
India has also consciously deepened the financial architecture supporting PPPs since 
2014. Long-term domestic capital, including pension funds, insurance funds, InvITs and 
Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), has increasingly participated in brownfield assets. 
However, greenfield PPPs continue to rely heavily on bank balance sheets. Expanding 
construction-period risk mitigation tools, partial credit guarantees in social sectors, take-
out financing, and standardised refinancing frameworks can materially lower the cost of 
capital. Equally important is creating predictable exit and restructuring pathways for 
stressed but viable projects, so that failure does not permanently impair investor confidence. 
A renegotiation framework for complex cases to prevent project termination is worth 
exploring. PPPs should be treated as evolving financial assets rather than one-time contracts 
frozen at financial close.
Finally, private sector participants that have benefitted from de-risked brownfield assets 
should be encouraged to increase their risk appetite for greenfield projects, particularly 
through pure-play PPP models such as BOT, especially in mature sectors like roads.
9.19 	 As also highlighted in the Economic Survey 2024-25, public sector efforts alone 
cannot meet India’s growing infrastructure requirements. While public investment 
remains crucial, a multi-pronged financing approach is essential to attract the 
requisite investments from the private sector and long-term institutional investors. 
This strategy requires strengthening resource mobilisation across all levels through 
innovative measures, including viable user charges and empowering municipal bodies 
to float bonds for localised resource generation. It also involves accelerating private 
participation including through public-private partnerships (PPPs). A wider array of 
PPP models with nuanced risk-sharing, right-price infrastructure services and a pipeline 
of bankable projects can facilitate infrastructure development significantly. Improved 
project preparation, standardised contracts and dispute resolution mechanisms are 
also critical to sustaining investor confidence and scaling PPPs.

efficiency and technological integration. Over the past decade, sustained investment 
and policy reforms have significantly expanded the National Highway (NH) network 
and improved construction pace, laying a stronger foundation for multimodal 
connectivity and economic integration (Chart IX.5 to Chart IX.8). For FY26, 10,000 km 
of construction is targeted, of which 4,938 km have been completed as of 31 December

Box IX.3: Key Initiatives and Reforms in the Roadways & Highways Sector
High Speed Connectivity and Urban Integration:
•	
High-Speed Corridor (HSC) Development: To align freight speeds with global 
benchmarks, the HSC network expanded from 550 km in 2014 to 5,364 km by December 
2025. A total network of approximately 26,000 km is targeted by FY33, with 9,366 km 
currently under implementation.8
•	
Economic Node Connectivity: Priority is accorded to highway projects linking ports, 
Inland Water Transport (IWT) terminals, and industrial corridors to lower logistics 
costs.
•	
Urban Decongestion: A new policy for access-controlled ring roads and bypasses 
has been finalised for cities with populations over 1 lakh. This employs innovative cost-
sharing models, such as land pooling and value capture, to transform urban centres into 
growth engines.
Privatisation and Asset Monetisation Roadmap:
•	
Public InvIT: The first Public InvIT is planned for launch in 2026. This follows a 
successful cumulative monetisation of ₹1.52 lakh crore through ToT and private InvITs.
•	
Project Pipeline: In line with the Budget announcement FY26, a dedicated PPP 
pipeline of 13,400 km (estimated cost of ₹8.3 lakh crore) has been identified for 
development over the next three years.
Reforms for improving Project Quality: 
•	
Project Preparation: Fixed-cost bidding and introduction of performance rating as 
part of bid evaluation.
•	
Construction: Stricter eligibility norms, Additional Performance Security for low bids 
and introducing contractor performance rating. 
•	
Use of Technology: Mandated use of drone surveys for alignment planning, 
deployment of Automated Intelligent Machine-Aided Construction (AIMC), and the 
use of pre-cast components for non-critical items mandated for projects above ₹300 
crores. Additionally, a Drone Analytics Monitoring System has been introduced for 
encroachment, along with AI-based detection of potholes and cracks using network 
survey vehicles.
9.21 		 Within the broader infrastructure landscape, rural roads development has played 
a critical role in improving last-mile connectivity and rural integration. The Pradhan 
Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) has achieved near-universal rural connectivity, 
with over 99.7 per cent of eligible habitations connected, as of 31 December 2025.9 The

programme has been strengthened through focused initiatives, including a dedicated 
road connectivity vertical under PM-JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya 
Maha Abhiyan) to serve Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PTVGs), targeting 8,000 
km of roads over the period 2023-28. As of 31 December 2025, 2,495 roads (7,323.96 
km of road length) and 163 bridges have been sanctioned under PM-JANMAN for 
connecting 2,909 habitations, out of which 248 roads (1242.41 km of road length) has 
been completed.10
9.22 	 Further momentum has been reinforced through PMGSY-IV, launched in 
September  2024, which aims to connect 25,000 unconnected habitations by constructing 
or upgrading 62,500 km of roads and bridges at an estimated cost of ₹70,125 crore 
during FY25–FY29. The phase adopts international standards, GIS-based surveys, and 
the PM GatiShakti framework, while converging with the Dharti Abha–Janjatiya Gram 
Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA-JGUA) scheme to prioritise habitations with high Scheduled 
Tribes population. So far, 2,490 roads (8,655.378 km of road length) and 01 bridge 
have been sanctioned under PMGSY-IV, which will provide connectivity to 2,734 new 
habitations.
9.23 	 Outlook: India’s roads and highways sector is moving from rapid network 
expansion towards greater logistics efficiency and quality. Sustained capital 
investment, expansion of high-speed corridors, multimodal integration under PM 
GatiShakti and reforms in project delivery are strengthening capacity and reliability. 
This infrastructure-led push is central for reducing logistics costs, easing congestion 
and improving connectivity.
Railways
9.24 	 Indian Railways continue to play a pivotal role in India’s infrastructure landscape 
by expanding network capacity, modernising assets, and strengthening multimodal 
connectivity. As of March 2025, the rail network has expanded to 69,439 Rkm. During 
FY26, it is targeted to extend the network further by 3,500 km. Electrification has 
reached 99.1 per cent of the network by October 2025.11 Sustained investments have 
enabled faster network expansion, with commissioning rates more than doubling in the 
post-2014 period compared to the previous decade (Chart IX.9).

9.25 	 A defining feature of recent years has been the record capital expenditure on 
railway infrastructure, with a focus on new lines, doubling and multi-tracking, rolling 
stock augmentation, signalling, and safety-related works. In FY26 (BE), capital outlay 
has been maintained at historically high levels, to accelerate capacity creation in a time 
bound manner (Chart IX.10). 
9.26 	 Railways have also emerged as a backbone of India’s freight and energy logistics, 
supporting coal movement, industrial supply chains, and containerised traffic through 
dedicated corridors, modern terminals, and first-mile connectivity projects. Parallel 
investments in stations, signalling, telecom and digital systems are improving network 
reliability, safety, and user experience (Box IX.4). 
Box IX.4: Key Infrastructure Initiatives in the Railways Sector
•	
Economic Railway Corridors (PM GatiShakti): Three corridor programmes—
Energy, Mineral & Cement; Port Connectivity; and High Traffic Density routes—are 
being implemented to strengthen multimodal connectivity and logistics efficiency. 434 
projects with an outlay of ₹11.17 lakh crore have been identified under three corridors 
and mapped on the PM GatiShakti portal. Of these, 122 projects covering 12,150 km 
have been sanctioned, and 198 projects spanning 19,779 km are under different stages 
of appraisal.
•   Major ongoing projects:
	
	
Mumbai–Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR): Over 55 per cent physical 
progress has been achieved as on October 2025, with land acquisition completed 
and most civil packages awarded, marking a major step towards introducing high-
speed rail infrastructure in India.
	
	
Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs): About 2,741 km (96.4 per cent) of the 
2,843 km DFC network has been commissioned as of October 2025, with the Eastern

     DFC (1,337 km) fully completed and 1,404 km of the 1,506 km Western DFC completed. 
These corridors are easing congestion on the passenger network, significantly reducing 
freight transit times and contributing to lowering logistics costs.
•	
Station Redevelopment: Under the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme, 1,337 stations have 
been identified for phased redevelopment, with works completed at select stations and 
progress underway across the country to improve capacity, accessibility and multimodal 
integration. Further, 15 stations have been identified to develop/redevelop on PPP 
mode.
•	
Safety & Technology Upgradation: Large-scale deployment of Kavach [Advance 
Train Protection (ATP) System], electronic interlocking, automatic block signalling, and 
track renewal are enhancing network safety and throughput.
•	
Track upgradation: More than 78 per cent of railway tracks have been upgraded for 
sectional speed of 110 kmph and above.
•	
Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs): 18 projects worth ₹16,636 crore have been 
completed and seven projects worth ₹16,334 crore are under implementation as on 
September 2025.12 
9.27 	 Outlook: Indian Railways is undergoing a transformation, driven by sustained 
capital investment, rapid network expansion, near-universal electrification and a 
corridor-based approach to capacity creation. Continued focus on dedicated freight 
corridors, economic rail corridors under PM GatiShakti, and modern signalling and 
station infrastructure is improving throughput, reliability and multimodal integration. 
These infrastructure-led initiatives will be central for reducing logistics costs, and 
strengthening connectivity.
Civil Aviation
9.28 	 India has emerged as the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market. The 
number of airports increased from 74 in 2014 to 164 in 2025.13 In FY25, Indian airports 
handled 412 million passengers, and the same is projected to increase to 665 million by 
FY31. Further, air cargo volume grew from 2.53 million metric tonnes (MMT) in FY15 
to 3.72 MMT in FY25, and 2.95 MMT handled in FY26 (until December), driven by 
several key policy initiatives and reforms (Box IX.5).14

9.29 	 Outlook: India’s civil aviation sector is on a sustained growth trajectory, 
supported by a conducive policy environment, rising demand and steady infrastructure 
expansion. While the sector remains sensitive to global economic cycles and the 
need for continuous capacity upgradation, the current passenger volumes represent 
only a fraction of India’s potential. Further, India currently operates approximately 
0.11 airports per million people, significantly lower than the US (47.35) and China 
(0.39)15, signalling substantial headroom for further growth. Expansion in India’s 
airport and air navigation infrastructure and a growing ancillary ecosystem, including 
Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) and leasing, are strengthening the sector. 
These developments, along with technology integration, positions civil aviation as a key 
driver of nationwide economic connectivity and integration.
Ports and Shipping
9.30 	 India’s maritime sector has undergone significant modernisation and is emerging 
as an essential pillar of logistics competitiveness, industrial growth and global supply-
chain integration. Under Maritime India Vision 2030 and Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision 
2047, substantial progress has been made in upgrading port infrastructure, enhancing 
regulatory frameworks, improving operational efficiency, and increasing private sector 
participation. 
9.31 		 India’s ports have demonstrated strong growth momentum, driven by 
accelerated capacity creation and a substantial increase in cargo throughput (Chart 
IX.13). Furthermore, mechanisation, smart port initiatives, and digital trade facilitation 
have significantly improved operational efficiency across major ports, with the average 
container vessel turnaround time achieving near-global best standards (Chart IX.14). 
India's growing competitiveness is reflected in global rankings, with two Indian ports 
now featuring among the top 30 and seven among the top 100 in the World Bank’s 
Container Port Performance Index 2024. Recent legislative reforms in the ports and 
shipping sector may be seen at Box IX.6.
15 	Airport density figures are calculated based on the total number of operational airports (commercial and general 
aviation) as reported in the CIA World Factbook 2025 and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Data 
Plus (2025 estimates), divided by the mid-year population projections from the World Bank Open Data 2025. 
High values for the USA (~47 per million) reflect a mature market with a high concentration of general aviation 
and municipal airfields (over 15,000). For India, the focus is primarily on commercial hubs and regional airports 
under active development schemes, indicating significant structural headroom for future expansion.

9.32 	 India has further strengthened the landlord port model16 to catalyse private 
investments in port development and operations. This strategic shift is evident in the 
substantial growth of PPP projects. The number of PPP projects awarded rose from 
37 in FY15 to 87 in FY25, with the total value of PPP projects increasing from ₹16,180 
crore to ₹61,029 crore, reflecting a 377 per cent rise. Currently, 57 operational PPP 
projects valued at ₹42,235 crore have increased port capacity by approximately 660 
MTPA. 
9.33 	 Outlook: PPP and captive operators are projected to handle 80 per cent of 
all cargo at major ports by 2030. A pipeline of 48 PPP projects worth approximately 
₹23,000 crore (excluding the Development of Vadhvan Port Project of worth ₹76,220 
crore) has been identified for the next five years (FY26 to FY31). These projects will 
further enhance the capacity and efficiency of India's Major Ports.17

Box IX.8: Urban Water Transport: Kochi Water 
Metro as a Scalable Model
The Kochi Water Metro (KWM), operational since 2023, represents a landmark shift in 
India’s urban mobility by re-establishing inland waterways as a sustainable mass transit 
option. The project is institutionalised through a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) incorporated 
in 2021, with the Government of Kerala holding 74 per cent equity and Kochi Metro Rail 
Limited (KMRL) holding the remaining 26 per cent. KMRL itself is a joint venture between 
the Government of India and the Government of Kerala.18
The project entails a planned network of 15 routes covering approximately 78 km, 
connecting 10 islands through 38 modern terminals and jetties. With a total project cost of 
about ₹819 crore, financing includes an €85 million long-term concessional loan from the 
German development bank KfW under the Indo-German Financial Cooperation framework, 
complemented by state government support.19

A defining feature of KWM is its deployment of air-conditioned electric-hybrid ferries 
designed and built by Cochin Shipyard Limited following a global tender. Each vessel carries 
around 100 passengers and is powered by lithium titanate oxide (LTO) batteries, enabling 
rapid charging and high cycle life. The terminals are designed with universal accessibility 
standards, and the service is fully integrated with the Kochi Metro Rail system through unified 
digital ticketing and interoperable smart cards, enabling seamless multimodal travel. As of 
2025, cumulative ridership has crossed five million passengers, with island communities 
such as Vypin, Bolgatty, and Mattancherry experiencing improved connectivity to the urban 
core.20
From a cost-effectiveness perspective, water metros offer a significant advantage over 
rail-based systems by leveraging existing waterways and minimising land acquisition 
and elevated infrastructure. Estimates suggest that a 75 km water metro network can be 
developed at roughly one-tenth the cost of a comparable elevated metro corridor, making it 
an attractive option for suitable urban geographies. However, scalability remains contingent 
on hydrological suitability, assured year-round navigability, availability of electric or 
alternative-fuel vessels, and coordinated financing across multiple levels of government.
The success of the KWM serves as a scalable model for other Indian cities with navigable water 
bodies, potentially offering sustainable and efficient transportation options.21 The model is 
being replicated in 21 cities, with feasibility studies in several cities in process, including 
Ayodhya, Dhubri, Goa, Guwahati, Kollam, Kolkata, Prayagraj, Patna, Srinagar, Varanasi, 
Mumbai, Vasai, Mangalore (Gurupura River), Gandhinagar-Ahmedabad (Sabarmati River), 
Alleppey in Kerala, as well as Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar Islands.22
Overall, the Kochi Water Metro demonstrates how institutional innovation, green 
technology, and multimodal integration can convert natural water assets into efficient 
urban infrastructure. While replication must remain context-specific and demand-driven, 
the model provides a credible template for sustainable urban transport in India’s riverine 
and coastal cities.
9.35 	 Outlook: India aims to increase the Inland Water Transport modal share from 
2 per cent to 5 per cent and raise cargo traffic to 200+ MMT by 2030 and 500 MMT by 
2047 under the Maritime Amrit Kaal Vision.
9.36 	 Shipbuilding: In September 2025, the Government of India approved a 
comprehensive package of ₹69,725 crore (approximately USD 8.3 billion) to revitalise 
the country’s shipbuilding and maritime ecosystem. The initiative adopts a four-
pillar approach aimed at developing a globally competitive, technologically advanced 
and sustainable maritime sector. Key policy initiatives and achievements driving the 
maritime transformation are elaborated in Box IX.9.

9.38 	 The Government of India implemented multiple initiatives aimed at supporting 
States/distribution utilities for providing uninterrupted power supply to every household. 
Under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), the Integrated Power 
Development Scheme (IPDS), introduced in 2014, and the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli 
Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA), introduced in 2017, about ₹1.85 lakh crore has 
also been invested to boost distribution infrastructure across various states.  Around, 
18,374 villages were electrified under DDUGJY, and 2.86 crore households have gained 
access to electricity during SAUBHAGYA period. To further support States to improve 
financial sustainability and operational efficiency of distribution utilities, the Revamped 
Distribution Sector Scheme was launched in 2021 with an outlay of ₹3.03 lakh crore, 
wherein projects worth ₹2.8 lakh crore have been approved to improve distribution 
infrastructure and implement smart metering solutions.24
9.39 	 These interventions have contributed significantly in improving power 
availability and reliability, particularly in rural areas (Chart IX.16). The gap between 
energy demand and supply has also declined from 4.2 per cent in FY14 to nil by 
November 2025.25 Besides, several initiatives have been undertaken to strengthen the 
viability and operational efficiency of Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) (Box IX.10).

9.40 	 To further strengthen distribution sector, the Government has proposed 
the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2026, with the objective of enhancing efficiency, 
competition, and financial discipline in the power sector. The Bill seeks to enable 
regulated competition in electricity distribution, promote cost-reflective tariffs, 
strengthen payment security for generators, and improve regulatory accountability, 
while continuing to safeguard subsidised supply for vulnerable consumers.26

Box IX.10: Reforming the last mile - Key initiatives to 
strengthen DISCOM finances
The distribution sector remains the most critical yet financially vulnerable segment of India’s 
power value chain. Operating as regulatory monopolies, many DISCOMs face operational 
inefficiency and financial distress. Between 2020-21 and 2024-25, accumulated losses 
rose from ₹5.5 lakh crore to ₹6.47 lakh crore, with outstanding debt increasing to ₹7.26 
lakh crore. This is rooted in non-cost-reflective tariffs, delayed state subsidies payment, 
and high Aggregate Technical and Commercial (AT&C) losses. To safeguard the long-term 
sustainability of the sector, the Government of India has introduced several reforms to 
strengthen the DISCOM finances, reduce losses, and ensure long-term sector sustainability 
including the following:-
1.	 Late Payment Surcharge (LPS) Rules: Streamlined payment discipline has sharply 
reduced outstanding dues from ₹1.4 lakh crore (June 2022) to ₹4,927 crore (January 
2026).  
2.	 Automatic Monthly Fuel & Power Purchase Cost Adjustment: Rules to provide 
for formula-based monthly tariff adjustments were notified to prevent cash-flow gaps 
for DISCOMs.
3.	 Recognition of Prudent Costs: Rules notified to allow pass through of prudent 
power procurement and distribution network costs, subject to regulatory approval.

4.	 Timely Recovery of Change-in-Law Costs: The 2021 Rules provide for automatic 
tariff adjustment to restore affected generators or licensees to their original economic 
position.
5.	 Effective Subsidy Accounting: Standard operating procedures laid to ensure timely 
release of state government subsidies and improve financial transparency.
6.	 Aggregate Technical and Commercial Loss Reduction Mandate: Loss reduction 
trajectories to be aligned with targets agreed under national schemes, promoting cost-
reflective tariffs.
7.	 Return on Equity (RoE) Alignment: State Commissions should allow reasonable 
RoE aligned with Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) norms, improving 
investor confidence.
8.	 Cost-Reflective Tariffs & Revenue Gap Liquidation: Tariffs must match the 
approved Annual Revenue Requirement, with any gap capped at 3 per cent (except 
during natural calamities).  New gaps must be cleared in three annual instalments, while 
legacy gaps (as of Jan 2024) must be recovered over seven instalments.
9.	 Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS): RDSS launched with the objective 
of improving the quality and reliability of power through a financially sustainable and 
operationally efficient distribution sector. The release of funds under the scheme is linked 
to States/ distribution utilities taking necessary measures to improve their performance.
10.	Additional Prudential Norms: As per the norms, financing to State-owned power 
utilities is linked to the operational performance of their respective State distribution 
utilities.
As a result of these measures, in a historic first,  the country’s power distribution utilities 
(DISCOMs and power departments) have recorded a positive Profit After Tax (PAT) of 
₹2,701 crore in FY25, marking a decisive turnaround from a loss of ₹67,962 crore in FY14. 
This improvement has been accompanied by a sustained reduction in Aggregate Technical 
and Commercial (AT&C) losses, from 22.62 per cent in FY14 to 15.04 per cent in FY25. 
Further, the Average Cost of Supply–Average Revenue Realised (ACS–ARR) gap (on an 
accrual basis) has also narrowed from ₹0.78/kWh in FY14 to ₹0.06/kWh in FY25, signalling 
much improved cost recovery.
Box IX.11: Enabling Consumer Agency, Open Innovation, and System 
Efficiency through India Energy Stack (IES)
India’s energy transition is reshaping the power sector from a centrally managed system 
to one that is increasingly distributed, digital, and participatory. Rooftop solar, smart 
meters, storage, electric mobility, and flexible demand are turning households, farmers, and 
MSMEs into active energy participants. This transition is not only about cleaner energy- it 
also carries the potential to create livelihoods and income opportunities for millions of small 
energy participants.

Investment and Infrastructure: Strengthening Connectivity, Capacity and Competitiveness
363
363
Yet the digital foundations of the sector remain fragmented. Data is locked in silos, 
integrations are bespoke and costly, and market participation does not scale. This limits 
consumer choice, constrains innovation, and creates inefficiencies for utilities and regulators 
alike and prevents distributed energy assets from translating into reliable income streams. 
The result is an energy system where value exists but remains difficult to access for ordinary 
consumers.27 
India Energy Stack (IES) will address this foundational gap. Conceived as a Digital Public 
Infrastructure (DPI) for the power sector, IES is envisioned to provide common digital 
rails that will enable trusted interactions among stakeholders and assets through open 
standards and protocols.28 Under the Ministry of Power’s leadership, a Taskforce has 
been setup with REC Limited as the nodal agency for driving the design, coordination, 
and phased implementation of India Energy Stack, leveraging its sector-wide institutional 
reach, financing expertise, and convening role across DISCOMs, state governments, and 
private stakeholders. IES is neither a centralised platform nor a central database. Data 
remains with rightful owners and is shared only through consent-based mechanisms. By 
standardising identity, data exchange, measurement, and settlement, IES will help create 
a power ecosystem that is interoperable, competitive, consumer-centric and capable of 
converting participation into economic value (see Chart IX.17).
Chart IX.17: IES impact on stakeholders

1.  Consumer value at the core: choice, participation, and income
    At its heart, IES aims at strengthening energy agency—the ability of consumers to 
choose services, participate in markets, and monetise their assets or actions.
	
•	
Simpler and portable participation: IES will facilitate interoperable interfaces 
with standardised onboarding and verified credentials. Consumers will not have to

              repeat documentation or technical integrations for each utility or service provider. 
IES will enable once-only participation across services, vendors, and geographies 
lowering transaction costs for all participants.
	
•	
Meaningful consumer choice through consent-based data sharing: IES 
will enable consumers to share their data securely and selectively with service 
providers of their choice. This will unlock competition in energy advisory, billing 
support, efficiency services, EV charging, and demand response. By making data 
portable, IES intends to avoid lock-in into a single utility or vendor workflow thereby 
enabling competition for better services on value, transparency, and outcomes.
	
•	
Monetisation of distributed assets: Small and distributed assets—rooftop 
solar, batteries, EV chargers, and flexible loads—only translate into income 
when measurement, verification, and settlement are reliable at scale. IES aims 
at standardising these foundational functions, enabling aggregation and market 
participation with confidence. Consumers will transform from passive recipients of 
energy into active participants.
2.  Open innovation and scalable energy markets
    IES does not prescribe business models. Instead, it creates the enabling conditions for 
markets to emerge. By lowering entry barriers and standardising interfaces, IES will 
enable a new ecosystem of service providers: peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platforms, 
demand-response and flexibility aggregators, rooftop and battery optimisation firms, 
EV charging operators, settlement and compliance services, and local energy advisors. 
These firms can operate locally while scaling nationally through common specifications 
creating significant economic value for the consumers in this process.
Peer-to-peer electricity trading offers a clear illustration. Prosumers—households, 
farmers, or MSMEs with surplus generation—will be able to sell electricity directly 
to other consumers, subject to grid and regulatory constraints. Without common 
protocols, P2P remains confined to pilots, and the IES will enable P2P trading at 
scale, including across utility jurisdictions, converting surplus energy into a tradable 
economic asset.
As these markets mature, advanced analytics and AI-enabled agents can generate 
insights or automate trading and flexibility decisions on behalf of consumers. This 
deepens participation while reducing complexity, allowing even small consumers to 
engage confidently in energy markets.
 3.  Structural benefits for DISCOMs and regulators
IES is envisaged to improve coordination in a distributed grid by providing common 
rules for trusted interaction reducing disputes, delays, and operational risk as 
transaction volumes scale.
For DISCOMs, scaled P2P trading reduces exposure to surplus energy payouts already 
settled between peers, while improving collection efficiency through wheeling charges. 
Standardised, near–real-time settlement improves demand forecasting and operational 
planning. Over time, this shifts utilities from being sole intermediaries to being system 
orchestrators in a more dynamic market.

Investment and Infrastructure: Strengthening Connectivity, Capacity and Competitiveness
365
365
Regulators benefit from enhanced transparency and enforceability. IES enables policy 
as code, where rules for settlement, penalties, compliance, and market participation 
are embedded into standardised protocols. 
4.  Enhancing livelihoods, and inclusion
IES is intended to ultimately connect system efficiency directly to consumer welfare 
and livelihood creation by enabling flexibility and participation as earn-able activities.
With implementation of standardised use cases at scale, Households, MSMEs, and 
agricultural consumers can monetise actions through options like off-peak EV charging, 
reduced cooling loads, or temporary load curtailment. IES enables verification and 
settlement at scale, allowing millions of small actions to be bundled into dependable 
grid support. This creates a new class of energy micro-entrepreneurs who earn not only 
by generating power, but also through consumer flexibility and services.
IES-enabled markets also align strongly with women-led livelihood programmes such 
as DAY–NRLM (Jeevika). Women Self-Help Groups can collectively own rooftop or 
community solar assets, trade surplus electricity, and power micro-enterprises in 
food processing, tailoring, dairy, and agri-allied activities. Reliable and affordable 
electricity improves productivity through mechanisation and cold-chain access, 
while participation in digital energy platforms strengthens financial inclusion, digital 
literacy, and leadership within village institutions. This convergence demonstrates how 
energy reform can advance inclusive growth and climate-resilient rural development 
simultaneously.
Openness with safeguards
IES balances open innovation with strong safeguards for privacy, cybersecurity, and grid 
security through verified identities, consent, audit trails, and conformance checks.
From energy access to energy agency: IES is not merely a technology initiative- it is 
a market-enabling reform that shifts the focus of India’s power sector from energy access 
to energy agency. By aligning consumer empowerment, open innovation, system efficiency 
and livelihood creation, IES gives every consumer the ability to choose, act, and earn from 
the energy transition at national scale.
Renewable energy 
9.41 	 India’s energy landscape is undergoing a structural transformation, with 
renewable energy (RE) now constituting around 49.83 per cent of the total installed 
power generation capacity as of 30 November 2025.29 The country maintains a dominant 
global presence, ranking third in overall RE capacity and installed solar capacity and 
fourth in installed wind capacity. Total RE capacity witnessed a more than threefold 
increase over the last decade, surging from 76.38 GW in March 2014 to 253.96 GW 
by November 2025.30 This substantial growth reflects the effectiveness of national 
renewable energy policies, large-scale project execution, and strong private sector 
participation in advancing India’s clean energy transition.
