The window for ‘Business As Usual’ (BAU) or ‘muddling through’ may be closing with respect to the economy, politics and financial markets. Chances of a moderate to significant disruption or a major rupture in world affairs exceed the chances of a ‘BAU’ scenario. As a country dependent on global capital flows, India has to plan for liquidity and external capital buffers in the coming year. Capital flight, including with the advent of U.S. stablecoins, is another risk to watch out for. India will remain better placed than most in its ability to maintain a decent growth rate, but its resilience will be tested as strategic vulnerabilities persist due to external dependence for capital, energy and other critical inputs, such as fertilisers."
