11.77.	 Expanding the scope of Tele-MANAS to address digital addiction represents a 
natural evolution of India’s national tele-mental health programme. Training dedicated 
counsellors and integrating Tele-MANAS with school and college systems can improve 
access, normalise help-seeking, and enable early intervention.
OUTLOOK
11.78.	 India's health and education sectors require unwavering focus to unlock the 
nation's true potential, especially in addressing interconnected new emerging issues 
such as the double burden of CDs and NCDs, increasing digital addiction, concerning 
mental health issues, poor nutrition, and increasing obesity. Together, they threaten 
the demographic dividend by perpetuating cycles of unemployment, inequality, and 
lost productivity. Open acknowledgement and constructive public discussion are 
important initial steps in addressing these challenges and promoting effective solutions. 
Normalising conversations around mental health, screen-time habits, and lifestyle-
related health issues can help foster collective awareness and action
11.79.	 Technology-driven surveys using platforms like the UDISE+, AISHE, ABDM 
and integration of AI tools can identify 'health hotspots' such as prevalence of obesity in 
urban slums or rising digital addiction in peri-urban schools. Public-private partnership 
can help develop frontline workers-led initiatives in India, employing technology like 
mobile apps, AI chatbots (ASHABot166), and digital dashboards (e.g., ASHA Kirana's 
M-CAT167 and ASHA Digital Health168), to effectively manage chronic conditions such as 
diabetes, monitor infectious diseases including COVID-19, and enhance maternal and 
child health outcomes.169  Running nationwide campaigns on Doordarshan and social 
media to highlight role models who inspire change in health and education efforts can 
be helpful. 
11.80.	 In sum, prioritising education, skilling, digital wellness, health, nutrition, and 
dietary habits through open dialogue, feedback surveys, success stories, and relatable 
role models will forge resilient citizens. This holistic approach would ensure a healthier, 
educated, skilled, thriving India.

EMPLOYMENT AND SKILL 
DEVELOPMENT : GETTING 
SKILLING RIGHT
India's workforce of over 56 crore holds tremendous potential for its economic 
growth. Labour market indicators point to a steady job market, with improving 
labour force participation, declining unemployment, and robust job creation in 
both the organised and unorganised sectors. 
To fully harness the demographic dividend, creating quality jobs with 
sustainable livelihoods is essential. The government has been working towards 
creating decent employment opportunities through structural reforms and 
targeted interventions. The recently enacted Labour Codes aim to strike a 
balance between flexibility and workers' rights, focusing on ensuring industry 
competitiveness while promoting worker welfare. Structural barriers to female 
participation are being addressed through the provision of safe, affordable 
accommodation and flexible and hybrid work arrangements. There is a growing 
focus on expanding social security, income protection, and grievance redressal 
mechanisms for gig and platform workers to safeguard their well-being. While 
addressing the quantity of labour, it is equally important to improve its quality, 
as economic growth relies on both the size and capabilities of its labour force. 
To achieve this, opportunities for vocational education at all levels are vital for 
strengthening the skill ecosystem and realising the Viksit Bharat's vision. 
INTRODUCTION
12.1.		 The labour markets in India are undergoing significant structural transformations 
driven by digitalisation, green energy transition, and emerging forms of employment 
such as gig and platform work.  In the post-pandemic growth phase, the emphasis has 
shifted from the quantity of jobs to the quality of work, reflecting a more inclusive 
and sustainable vision of the labour market. Recent government initiatives aimed at 
promoting labour-intensive sectors and strengthening skill development underscore 
this renewed commitment to quality employment and human capital enhancement. 
12.2		 India continues to benefit from a large working-age population (in the age 
group 15-59), expected to exceed 98 crore in the next 10 years.1  According to the UN

projections, India’s demographic dividend2 is expected to peak around 2030, when 
nearly 65 per cent of the population will fall within the 15-59 years group.3 At the 
same time, the population is gradually ageing: the total fertility rate has fallen below 
replacement levels and life expectancy has steadily increased, raising the median age 
and signalling the onset of a demographic transition towards an older population. 
12.3		 While the expansion of the working-age population presents opportunities, the 
concurrent ageing trend introduces challenges for labour markets and social support 
systems. This demographic shift also opens the possibility of harnessing the longevity 
dividend.4 Realising this dividend requires policies that extend health spans through 
preventive healthcare, healthy lifestyles, and management of non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs), alongside financial support, accessible healthcare, and social 
services for older adults. Epidemiological reports also indicate a rise in NCDs such as 
cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and mental health challenges among the productive 
age groups. This concern has been discussed in detail in Chapter 11 of this Economic 
Survey. Investments in biomedical research, lifelong learning5, age-friendly work 
arrangements, and targeted programmes for informal and unorganised workers will 
ensure that longer life spans translate into sustained productivity and social well-being.6 
12.4		 The Economic Survey 2024-25 highlighted the need for deregulation in the 
labour market to enable a virtuous cycle of job creation and the need to address the skill 
mismatch in the labour market to improve the employability of the workforce. Skilling 
initiatives in employment not only bridge skill gaps and enhance productivity and 
decent work opportunities, but they also catalyse social mobility by enabling upward 
economic progression, thereby fostering greater equality in access to inclusive labour 
markets. Chapters 11 and 13 of this survey discuss the role of education, healthcare, 
community development, and infrastructure development in enhancing human 
capacity and promoting social mobility. It also highlights how the state can effectively 
utilise these policy tools to achieve more equitable outcomes. 
12.5		 This Chapter concentrates on supply-side policy levers to support inclusive 
employment development. An analysis of the employment landscape of the economy 
and the drivers of a more inclusive labour market has been presented. The first section 
examines the state of employment, focusing on the sectoral and gender distribution

participation and increasing involvement in the manufacturing sector. The second 
section examines how the recently notified Labour Codes can catalyse job creation. It 
also discusses the evolving nature of the gig workforce. The third section addresses the 
challenge of re-strategising the vocational education framework to prepare the youth 
for the evolving demands of industry. The last section concludes with an outlook for 
employment and skilling landscape. 
EMPLOYMENT OVERVIEW
12.6		 Employment is not a standalone metric but a downstream result of a thriving 
economy. As the 'State of Economy' chapter 1 of the Survey describes, India’s economic 
growth remains resilient and stable, leading to improved employment opportunities 
and better labour market parameters. Over the past year, India has introduced several 
significant reforms, including a major overhaul of its tax regime and various deregulation 
measures (discussed in Chapter 16, Part II of this survey) aimed at boosting business 
growth and job creation.
12.7	 	 As a result of these reforms, the labour market continues to show steady activity 
as revealed by official monthly and quarterly Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) 
data alongside the establishment-level data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) 
for the manufacturing sector and the Quarterly Bulletin of Unincorporated Sector 
Enterprises (QBUSE) for the non-agricultural sector. Together, these sources highlight 
improving labour force participation, falling unemployment, and strong job creation in 
both the organised and unorganised sectors.
12.8		 The quarterly and monthly PLFS data show a steady labour market with seasonal 
variations.7 It indicates that the period from April to September 2025 (H1 FY26) saw 
a declining unemployment rate (UR)8 in the current weekly status (CWS)9 with a 
stabilising labour force participation rate (LFPR)10, and substantial employment levels, 
signalling an improvement in employment conditions. A total of 56.2 crore people (aged 
15 years and above) were employed in Q2 (July to September 2025) FY26, reflecting a 
creation of 8.7 lakh new jobs in Q2 compared to Q1 (April to June 2025) of FY26.11
7 	 The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) published the first monthly bulletin of the 
revised PLFS in April 2025. The bulletin presents key labour market indicators, for both rural and urban areas, 
based on the Current Weekly Status (CWS) of individuals. Along with the monthly PLFS, MoSPI has revamped 
the quarterly survey to include all-India and rural estimates, as well as urban estimates. https://tinyurl.com/

9 	 The activity status determined on the basis of a reference period of the last 7 days preceding the date of the survey 
is known as the CWS of the person.
10 	LFPR is defined as the percentage of persons in the labour force (i.e. working or seeking or available for work) in 
the population.

12.9		 The PLFS data reveal a distinct and layered employment structure in India, 
marked by rural-urban differences. Rural employment is dominated by agricultural 
workers (57.7 per cent) and self-employment (62.8 per cent), with women workers 
showing relatively higher participation in them. In contrast, urban employment is 
primarily concentrated in the services sector (62.0 per cent), with regular wage or 
salaried jobs making up the largest share (49.8 per cent). At the aggregate level, in Q2 
FY26, agriculture and self-employment accounted for 42.4 per cent and 55.8 per cent 
of total employment, respectively, while casual labour constituted 18.9 per cent.
12.10	 As per the latest PLFS data for Q2 FY26, despite some shifts towards non-farm 
activities, agriculture still employs a significant share of rural workers, showing a 
seasonal increase tied to agrarian cycles. This highlights the crucial role of agriculture 
in rural employment and the necessity of designing policies that focus on decent work 
in this sector, particularly given its seasonal nature and the movement of workers 
between farm and non-farm activities.12
12.11	 These employment patterns have important gender dimensions. The proportion 
of women engaged in self-employment or contributing to household enterprises, 
especially in rural areas, is relatively high. Women’s participation in regular wage jobs 
is 10.8 per cent in Q2 FY26 in rural areas, coinciding with a major share of women 
working as ‘own account workers/employers’ (37.5 per cent) or ‘helpers in household 
enterprises’ (34.2 per cent).   These patterns highlight a tendency among female workers 
towards independent work and entrepreneurship, which offers flexibility. The findings 
of the Time Use Survey (TUS) conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme 
Implementation (MoSPI) highlight the dual burden that female workers face in terms 
of caregiving activities and unpaid work, which may explain their desirability or 
inclination towards flexible work models (Box XII.1). 
Box XII.1: Balancing the scales: Insights from Time Use Survey 2024
The TUS enables the measurement of the time individuals spend on different activities. The 
primary objective of the survey is to measure the participation of men, women, and other 
groups of persons in paid and unpaid activities. India is among the few countries, including 
Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, the USA, and China, that conduct the 
National TUS to analyse how people allocate their time to various daily activities.13
12 UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 defines decent work as opportunities for everyone to get work that is 
productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects 
for personal development and social integration.

The MoSPI conducted the first all-India TUS from January to December 2019. The key 
findings of the recent TUS conducted from January to December 2024 (the second such all-
India survey14) are as follows:
Increased participation in employment and related activities15: The survey 
reflects an increased participation rate16 of both men and women in employment and related 
activities. During 2024, 75 per cent of males and 25 per cent of females in the 15-59 years 
age group participated in employment and related activities during the 24-hour reference 
period. Such participation was 70.9 per cent for males and 21.8 per cent for females aged 
15-59 years in 2019.17
Females are the predominant caregivers: Looking at the time spent in caregiving 
activities, the survey findings reveal that women are the main caregivers. 41 per cent of 
females aged 15-59 years participated in caregiving for their household members; male 
participation in this age group was 21.4 per cent. Female participants spent about 140 
minutes daily in caregiving activities, compared to 74 minutes spent by male participants 
aged 15-59 years.18
More of the female activity time remains unpaid: Evidence from the survey highlights 
gender differences in participation in paid and unpaid activities. For all persons aged 6 years 
and above participating in unpaid activities, the average time spent on these activities per 
day was 278 minutes, whereas for paid activities, it was 386 minutes per day.19   Females 
spent, on average, 363 minutes a day on unpaid activities, while males spent only around 
123 minutes a day on unpaid activities. Consequently, male participants spent 414 minutes 
a day in paid activities, against 302 minutes spent by female participants. 
Females balanced dual work burden: The combined time spent on paid and unpaid 
activities by female members is higher than that of men.  Female household members spend 
significantly more time on unpaid activities than men. While women participating in paid 
work contribute a considerable amount of time, their overall participation remains lower 
than that of men. The estimates highlight the dual burden of work on female participants. 
(refer to the chart below). 
14 	In TUS, 2024, respondents were asked about their activities performed in the designated time slots of 30 minutes 
and the same was recorded against the corresponding slot. In case of multiple activities in a time slot, a maximum 
of three activities performed for 10 minutes or more were recorded. Information on time use was collected for 
persons aged 6 years and above with a reference period of 24 hours. This survey covered 1,39,487 households 
(rural: 83,247 and urban: 56,240). Information on time use was collected from each member aged 6 years and 
above of the selected households.

The findings of the TUS 2024 highlight the care sector's vast potential for increasing the 
female labour force participation rate (FLFPR), as noted in the Economic Survey 2023-
24.20 The findings also reinforce the recommendations of the Economic Survey 2024-25 for 
increasing women’s participation in the workforce, such as the provision of a flexible work 
policy, removal of statutory restrictions on women's labour force participation, availability 
of childcare facilities and crèches, skill development programmes aligned to industry needs, 
and the adoption of a long-term strategy focused on women and girls, which will help 
increase female participation in paid work. 21 
Over the past year, states have made significant progress in reforming statutory regulations 
to enhance women’s participation in the economy. Key reforms include removing 
prohibitions on women’s employment in designated ‘hazardous’ industries by 17 states/
UTs and permitting night-time work for women in factories by around 22 states/UTs, as 
well as in commercial establishments by 33 states/UTs, thereby expanding employment 
opportunities for women while improving labour market flexibility. Chapter 16, Part II of 
this Economic Survey provides a detailed examination of the efforts undertaken by states to 
remove regulatory frictions in the labour market and unlock economic potential.
12.12	 India’s vision for Viksit Bharat 2047 places women at the core of the national 
development agenda, with progress envisioned to be women-led. Estimates suggest 
that increasing participation to around 55 per cent by the 2050 could be critical for 
maintaining a high annual GDP growth trajectory.22 While women’s participation in 
paid work is rising slowly, the imbalance underscores the need for policies that promote 
shared domestic responsibilities and better care infrastructure. Box XII.2 discusses key 
policy lessons for enhancing the FLFPR.

Box XII.2: Enhancing female labour force participation 
India has witnessed a positive trend in FLFPR in recent years. It has risen from 23.3 per cent 
in 2017-18 to 41.7 per cent in 2023-24, alongside a decline in UR from 5.6 per cent to just 3.2 
per cent, reflecting a shift toward greater inclusion and economic empowerment.23
According to the Women and Men in India, 202424 report the share of female-headed 
proprietary establishments has shown a positive trend, increasing from 24.2 per cent in 
2021-202225 to 26.2 per cent in 2023-24.26 The share of female-headed establishments is 
highest for the manufacturing sector at 58.4 per cent in 2023-24. It is also observed that 
states with a higher presence of female-headed establishments, such as West Bengal, 
Karnataka, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh, also have higher FLFPR.
Despite these improvements in economic participation, women workers continue to face 
structural barriers, including limited mobility, lack of affordable housing, and inflexible 
work arrangements that conflict with caregiving responsibilities, underscoring the need for 
a multipronged policy approach to further enhance participation.
Improving access to STEM: Many highly educated women continue to work in low-
productivity jobs or part-time roles due to social expectations, mobility constraints, and 
limited access to flexible formal employment. PLFS 2023-24 indicates that women aged 25 
years and above with advanced degrees constitute only 2.9 per cent of the employed female 
workforce in rural and urban areas.27 Women are also less likely to pursue STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, accounting for 43 per cent of enrolment 
in 2021-22.28 This could be attributed partly to perceptions of STEM as a male domain, 
care responsibilities, early marriage, and higher education costs.29 Encouraging women’s 
participation in STEM disciplines can help bridge the skills gap and expand their access to 
employment opportunities30, including white-collar services and modern manufacturing.
Improving urban mobility: Urban areas offer higher returns to education and better 
job quality. However, mobility-related barriers restrict women’s ability to take up urban 
employment.  The use of public transportation by women in India differs significantly from 
that of men. Women often travel during off-peak hours, accompanied by children, and make 
multiple short trips to handle household chores or perform caregiving activities.31
According to a World Bank study (2021), 31 per cent of women cited commuting as a barrier 
to working, 13 per cent reported childcare responsibilities were a barrier to commuting for

 work, and 19 per cent indicated that domestic duties were a barrier to commuting for work.32 
The study also highlighted that a lack of security leads women to choose safer but more 
expensive modes of transport, a phenomenon known as the ‘Pink Tax.’33
To overcome the systemic barriers women face in urban mobility, policy must focus on 
extending safety infrastructure and providing affordable intermediate transport to cover 
women's entire travel chain, from doorstep to destination. Key policy interventions could 
include enhancing visible women police presence for patrols in high traffic and pedestrian 
areas, especially during off-peak hours (like Kochi's Women Police Control Room vans and 
Hyderabad's SHE Teams), and increasing women drivers through targeted recruitment 
and training programmes (like National Capital Region Transport Corporation’s initiative 
to train women aged 18-35 in professional driving through a structured 21-day course, 
combining classroom instruction, simulators, on-road training, and licensing support). 
Furthermore, the prioritisation of safe and accessible walking and cycling infrastructure 
in urban areas with gender-responsive elements like adequate lighting and safe crossings, 
and enhanced safety features (such as emergency buttons in vehicles and police verification 
of drivers, Chennai's inclusive street design manual and Bhubaneswar's Janpath Street) is 
required at scale through sustained efforts.34 
Affordable housing for working women: Expanding secure hostels and affordable 
rental housing can improve women’s access to urban jobs. At the same time, women-
centric industrial clusters and manufacturing hubs can create targeted avenues for female 
employment. The Sakhi Niwas scheme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development is 
a gender-inclusive infrastructure intervention designed to create a supportive ecosystem for 
women navigating work and mobility. Another example is Tamil Nadu’s Working Women’s 
Hostels Corporation (‘Thozhi Hostels’), set up through Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), 
with gender-responsive design, furnished rooms, crèches, kitchens, and shared spaces, which 
offers a practical blueprint for states seeking to expand women’s workforce participation.
Care economy: Expanding the network of Anganwadi centres, integrating community 
crèches, and incentivising employer-linked childcare can ease the unpaid care burden. 
Professionalising care work can also generate formal employment for women within the 
social sector. 
Skill development: Aligning training programmes with industry demand, particularly 
in manufacturing, renewable energy, digital services, and agro-processing, can ensure that 
women are equipped for emerging opportunities. Initiatives such as ‘Back to Work’ and 
‘Returnship programmes’ for women who have taken career breaks can bridge re-entry 
barriers. Integrating self-help groups (SHGs) with the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises

products, and clothing) and services (such as mortgages and dry cleaning). The pink tax on mobility refers to the 
fact that women may have to pay a higher price to reach the same destinations because of gender-specific needs 
that are not addressed by the transport system.

increase access to markets, and help them move from subsistence entrepreneurship to

Flexibility in employment: Policies should promote flexible work, hybrid models, and 
gender-responsive standards, including maternity benefits, equal pay, and harassment 
protection. The newly enacted Labour Codes now allow women workers to work from home 
(Section 59(5), Code on Social Security 2020) after availing themselves of the maternity 
benefit (Section 60, Code on Social Security 2020).
Public-private partnership: Several states are promoting women’s participation in the 
workforce through innovative, partnership-based models. Telangana’s WE-Hub connects 
women with start-up ecosystems and investors.35 Kerala’s Kudumbashree integrates 
microfinance and collective enterprises to engage women in non-traditional roles, such 
as construction, logistics, and facility management.36 Maharashtra’s Mahila Arthik Vikas 
Mahamandal links SHG to formal credit and enterprise support. Scaling these context-
specific approaches can expand women’s opportunities and accelerate their entry into 
higher-value work.37
Efforts to challenge restrictive social norms must continue through awareness campaigns, 
gender sensitisation in schools, and community-led initiatives that promote shared 
caregiving and domestic responsibilities. In addition, it is essential to expand women’s 
access to credit and procurement opportunities. Mentorship and future-oriented skills such 
as digital literacy, hybrid work capabilities, and green job training can further enhance 
female workforce participation. 
Increasing women’s participation in the labour market is not merely a matter of inclusion 
but a key driver of India’s long-term economic transformation, as higher female employment 
supports fairer labour market outcomes, strengthens household welfare and contributes to 
building a more inclusive, resilient, and productive economy on the path to Viksit Bharat by 
2047.
The unorganised workforce
12.13	 Recent policy initiatives have prioritised identifying unorganised workers and 
enhancing their integration with the formal economy through the welfare and skill 
development systems. The Code on Social Security, 2020 (CSS) defines unorganised 
workers as home-based, self-employed or wage workers in the unorganised sector and 
includes a worker in the organised sector who is not covered by the Industrial Disputes 
Act, 1947.38
35 	https://wehub.telangana.gov.in/
36 	https://www.kudumbashree.org/pages/171
37 	https://mavimindia.org/en/overview
38 	‘Unorganised worker’ means a home-based worker, self-employed worker or a wage worker in the unorganised 
sector and includes a worker in the organised sector who is not covered by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 or 
Chapters III to VII of the CSS (Section 2 (86)).

12.14	 In this context, the e-Shram portal is steadily bridging the gap between informal 
and formal employment, serving as a key institutional mechanism for extending social 
protection to unorganised workers.39 The portal serves as a National Database of 
Unorganised Workers, which includes data on construction workers, migrant workers, 
gig and platform workers, street vendors, domestic workers, and agriculture workers. 
As of January 2026, the portal has successfully registered over 31 crore unorganised 
workers, marking a significant advancement in India’s efforts to formalise and support 
its informal workforce. Notably, women account for 54 per cent of total registrants, 
substantially strengthening the reach of gender-focused welfare schemes. Each 
registrant is assigned a Universal Account Number (UAN), which is linked to their 
Aadhaar and mobile number, ensuring the portability of scheme benefits when workers 
move across platforms, locations, or employment arrangements.
12.15	 e-Shram is evolving into a comprehensive platform for unorganised workers. 
It facilitates the identification of job opportunities, apprenticeship opportunities, and 
skilling linkages, helping workers transition to improved employment prospects. These 
efforts align with the broader vision of enhancing productivity and social protection for 
India’s informal workforce. 
12.16	 The platform facilitates the delivery of social security and welfare schemes to 
registrants. Eighteen (18) social security schemes, including ‘One-Nation- One-Ration 
Card’, National Social Assistance Programme, National Career Service (NCS), Pradhan 
Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan (PMSYM). etc, have been integrated with e-Shram. The 
portal also shares details of e-Shram registrants with all states/UTs, which helps them 
ensure targeted delivery and widespread coverage of welfare schemes for unorganised 
workers.
12.17	 Launched in 2015, the NCS is a one-stop solution connecting job seekers, 
employers, training providers and career guidance and counselling agencies.40 It offers 
a range of services, including free registration, job application processing, interview 
assistance, and other employment-related services, and a multi-lingual helpline. 
The portal has a job fair module to streamline recruitment activity by engaging all 
stakeholders, i.e., model career centres, nodal officers, job seekers and employers at 
one platform. The portal’s integration with the Ministry of External Affairs’ eMigrate 
system enables certified recruiting agencies to post verified international job vacancies 
and provides job seekers with access to global opportunities under safe and monitored 
conditions.

12.18	  Additionally, its integration with the Skill India Digital Hub (SIDH) enables 
candidates to enhance their skill sets before applying for jobs. The portal is partnering 
with private portals to provide free online training on 'career skills' and ‘digital skills’. It 
is also linked with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), the Employees' 
State Insurance Corporation (ESIC), DigiLocker, e-Shram, Udyam and SIDH, ensuring 
seamless access to workforce data. Currently, the portal is integrated with 30 State 
employment portals, including seven states/UTs, which are directly using it for job 
seeker registrations.
12.19	 Since its launch, the portal has evolved into a key employment facilitation 
platform, with over 5.9 crore registered job seekers and 53 lakh job providers across 
diverse sectors and mobilising approximately 8 crore vacancies. It recorded over a 200 
per cent increase in job vacancies in FY24 compared to FY23. Vacancies mobilised 
exceeded 2.8 crore in FY25 and have already crossed 2.3 crore by September 2025.
Employment in the organised manufacturing sector
12.20	 The ASI conducted by MoSPI, covers the organised manufacturing sector and 
provides insight into employment trends in the sector.41,42  The ASI results for FY24 
highlight the manufacturing sector’s resilience, showing a 6 per cent YoY increase in 
employment over the previous year.43 This translates to an addition of over 10 lakh 
jobs in FY24 compared to FY23. The sector added more than 57 lakh jobs over the past 
decade, between FY15 and FY24, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4 per 
cent.
12.21	 The survey highlights rising net value added (NVA) per person engaged in 
the organised manufacturing sector. This signals improved labour productivity and 
output efficiency, with each employed person contributing substantially more to total 
value creation than in previous years. The sector also experienced positive growth in 
emoluments per person. 
41 	The ASI coverage extends to the entire Factory Sector comprising industrial units (called factories) registered 
under the Sections 2(m)(i) and 2(m)(ii) of the Factories Act, 1948, with ten or more workers with electricity or 20 
or more workers without electricity. (https://tinyurl.com/ycxvk3w8)
42 	The reference period of the survey is April 2023 to March 2024. The field work for this survey was carried out 
from October 2024 to June 2025.
43 Employment refers to total persons engaged (TPE), which includes the employees (which include workers and 
clerical/administrative staff) and all working proprietors and their family members who are actively engaged in 
the work of the factory even without any pay, and the unpaid members of the cooperative societies who worked 
in or for the factory in any direct and productive capacity.

12.24	 Compared to a 26 per cent increase in the number of smaller factories, the number 
of large factories has almost doubled over the last decade (increasing by 97 per cent 
between FY14 and FY24). Thus, in terms of total persons engaged (TPE), employment 
has been rising in larger factories at a CAGR of 6 per cent compared to a CAGR of 2 per 
cent in smaller ones. This represents an improvement in employment quality, as large 
factories are associated with higher wages and greater worker productivity.

Boosting manufacturing workforce participation
12.27	 The manufacturing sector is critical for national self-reliance and strategic 
resilience, serving as a central pillar of India’s growth and strengthening its role in 
global value chains. Competing globally requires not only capital and technology but 
also a focus on labour, including worker well-being, gender inclusivity, and harnessing 
the demographic dividend. Labour is crucial to the sector’s expansion, with 11.4 per 
cent of total employment in the manufacturing sector in 2023-24.47 About 1.9 crore 
persons are employed in the organised manufacturing sector48, while about 3.3 crore 
persons are employed in the unorganised manufacturing sector.49 Enhancing worker 
participation is essential for enhancing productivity and sustainable long-term growth.
12.28	 Evidence from civil society-private sector partnerships shows that targeted 
interventions in worker well-being drive both business competitiveness and national 
prosperity. Some of these interventions are discussed in Box XII. 3.
Box XII.3: Building a resilient and productive workforce 
Workplace conditions play a critical role in shaping workers’ well-being and productivity. 
For factory workers, the time spent at the workplace is defined not only by hours of work 
but also by the quality of working conditions and the availability of adequate space for work 
and living. Migrant workers manage all these pressures while living and working in a foreign 
environment. In this context, it is essential for employers to provide a conducive working 
environment that enhances worker engagement in the tasks assigned to them.
To foster a holistic approach to workforce welfare, interventions focusing on three critical 
dimensions of employee well-being: financial, mental, and physical health, can play a key 
role in improving overall productivity.
Mental well-being through the ‘buddy’ system: Many women migrate to urban 
manufacturing hubs for employment. While this offers financial gains, many individuals 
face loneliness and social isolation, which negatively impact their mental well-being and 
productivity at work. This can also lead to high early attrition, representing lost gains for 
workers and increased costs for employers. Evidence suggests that strong social connections

reduce anxiety, loneliness, and depression, thereby improving an individual’s ability to 
adapt, engage, and remain in their employment.50,51,52
To address the social drivers of retention for new migrant workers, a study was conducted 
(from January 2023 to December 2024) by pairing new migrant women workers in 
factories in Bangalore with experienced peers or ‘buddies’ who share a similar language 
and background. Buddies were trained in basic cognitive-behavioural techniques to provide 
emotional first-aid and help newcomers navigate workplace and community life. This 
simple, low-cost intervention demonstrated remarkable success, showing a 5.3 per cent 
reduction in anxiety and a 5.9 per cent reduction in depression among workers. From the 
firm’s perspective, while there was a marked productivity increase of 6.4 per cent among 
new workers, paired with a senior buddy, a more surprising 12 per cent increase in worker 
productivity was observed among senior buddies. 53 
Financial well-being with earned wage access (EWA): EWA, also known as 
on-demand pay, is a service designed to meet the immediate short-term liquidity needs 
of workers. It allows users to access part or all of their wages as they earn them, before 
their next scheduled payday. Financial stress among workers can be a significant barrier 
to productivity. Research shows that financial pressures reduce cognitive bandwidth and 
are nearly five times more likely to be a source of distraction at work.54,55,56 To address this, 
an EWA intervention could help manage financial stress, improve employee retention and 
worker welfare.57 Evidence from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) from March 2023 
to October 2024, involving over 800 women workers, found that access to liquidity led 
to substantial gains in well-being. The study found a reduction in high-interest informal 
borrowings, alongside a 20 per cent decline in the likelihood of workers forgoing essential 
expenditures. This improved financial stability resulted in a reduction in worker turnover

and an increase in worker productivity, positioning financial well-being as a factor yielding 
clear returns for both employees and employers.58
Physical well-being through sexual and reproductive health (SRH) awareness: 
The physical well-being of women workers is often impacted by low awareness and social 
norms surrounding SRH, which limit their access to information and care. This can be 
addressed through a capacity-building programme at the workplace. Evidence suggests 
that SRH training can improve general health behaviours and result in a higher rate of 
contraceptive use. Notably, there was also a significant increase in the reporting of sexual 
harassment experienced in public spaces, reflecting greater awareness and confidence.59 
These models demonstrate the effectiveness of workplace-based programs in overcoming 
information barriers, offering a scalable pathway to improve women's health and well-
being.60  
These examples demonstrate that a focus on holistic well-being (mental, financial, and 
physical) creates a more resilient, secure, and productive workforce. Such a foundation of 
a supported and healthy workforce is a critical prerequisite for tackling broader national 
priorities, such as increasing women’s participation in manufacturing sectors, and ensuring 
India's industrial growth is both sustainable and inclusive.
CATALYSING JOB GROWTH
12.29	 The four Labour Codes- Code on Wages 2019, Industrial Relations Code 
2020, CSS and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code 2020 
have consolidated 29 central laws to streamline regulations and extend protections 
to workers. The implementation of these Codes was notified on 21 November 2025. 
The Codes have attempted to strike a balance between regulation and flexibility, while 
protecting worker rights and ensuring social security for workers. They are a result of 
the deliberations held in the tripartite meeting of the government, employers, industry 
representatives, and various trade unions from 2015 to 2019. 61
12.30	 The Codes have introduced formal recognition for gig workers (CSS) (Sections 
2(35) & 2(60)), mandatory appointment letters for all (Occupational Safety, Health and 
Working Condition Code,2020), portable social security for migrant workers (CSS), 
equal benefits (including gratuity and leave after one year) for fixed-term and contract 
58 The study was conducted by GBL. GBL developed a simple, Android-based tablet application for the workplace, 
which enabled workers to withdraw their earned wages via direct transfer to their bank account with just a few 
taps. It also conducted an RCT with 408 women in the treatment group and 426 women in the control group, 
along with baseline, midline, and endline surveys to assess the state of household finances. Furthermore, GBL 
analysed worker-level administrative data, including tenure, daily attendance, wages, and output, as well as an 
analysis of EWA tool utilisation, including per-worker transaction frequency and transaction size.

workers, a minimum wage, and timely payments, as well as a national floor wage (Code 
on wages, 2019). The simplified compliance with a single licence for contract staffing is 
poised to accelerate formalisation and inclusive growth. 
12.31	 Complementing the roll-out of the Centre’s Labour Codes, 32 states/UTs have 
published draft rules under the Codes. Notably, the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government 
has recently notified new rules allowing women to work night shifts, provided they are 
accompanied by mandatory safeguards, including employer-provided transportation, 
health facilities, CCTV surveillance, security personnel, and double wages for overtime 
work. The quarterly overtime cap has been raised to 144 hours.
12.32	 In UP, the amendment to the Factories Act, 1948, enables women to work in 
all 29 hazardous sectors, promoting gender equality, industrial modernisation, and 
increased female workforce participation. The reform is supported by enhanced 
safety infrastructure, including helplines, police beats, and dedicated anti-harassment 
squads.62  
12.33	 Implementing the Codes marks the first step towards the labour market 
transformation. The transition will require coordination and investment from the 
private sector. Companies must enhance their systems, update policies, reevaluate 
workforce models, and improve their digital readiness to remain competitive. While 
the Codes offer a unified framework, it is up to the private sector to integrate this 
framework into daily operations. The impact of the Labour Code on the labour market 
is discussed in Box XII.4.
Box XII.4: Economics of the Labour Codes
Labour is a concurrent subject in the Constitution of India, and until recently was regulated 
by more than 140 laws (Central and State) with overlapping jurisdictions and inconsistent 
definitions.63 The multiplicity of laws led to difficulties in compliance and multiplicity of 
authorities in different labour laws, leading to complexity and difficulty in enforcement. 
This resulted in a complex regulatory framework, underscoring the need for a flexible, 
streamlined and efficient reform to encourage entrepreneurship, support firm growth, and 
promote productive employment. 
Government regulatory measures are as influential in resource allocation as the invisible 
hand of the market.  Empirical studies highlight the policy trade-offs between labour market 
flexibility and regulation, showing that while regulations protect workers from exploitation,

overly rigid policies may reduce investment, employment, productivity, and output in 
registered manufacturing, and encourage informal sector activities.64 Supporting this, 
another study conducted in 2025, evaluating the impact of state labour law reforms in 
India on employment, output, new industrial units, investment, and unit sizes, found that 
inflexible labour laws led to slower growth of large industrial units and fewer regular jobs. 
States with flexible labour laws show significantly higher employment, fixed capital, and 
output compared to those with inflexible laws.65 
Thus, amid external headwinds, India’s push for global competitiveness hinges on reforms 
that simplify business processes and labour regulations. The government’s step to consolidate 
29 central laws into four comprehensive Labour Codes would simplify compliance, update 
outdated provisions, and create a streamlined, effective framework that enhances ease of 
doing business while protecting workers’ rights and welfare. 
Impact on female labour force participation: Research shows that fewer restrictions 
correlate with a lower female unemployment rate, higher FLFPR, more women in 
management roles, and a smaller wage gap compared to states with stricter restrictions on 
women's labour.66 Further, removing legal restrictions on women’s employment benefits 
women and economies. Allowing women to work at night is associated with a higher 
likelihood of women becoming top managers.67 The new Labour Codes enable women 
to work across all establishments, including those with night shifts, with the necessary 
safety measures in place. They promote gender equality through equal wages68, provision 
of creches69, flexibility through work-from-home provision70 and expansion of maternity 
benefits71, thereby supporting higher participation in the workforce. According to the Indian 
Staffing Federation estimates, the gender provisions, including consensual night work, 
could elevate FLFPR to 33.7 per cent.
Impact on formalisation: The Labour Codes mandate the issuance of appointment letters 
for all, with the provision of equal benefits (including gratuity after one year) for fixed-term 
and contract workers, and a single pan-India registration/license/return, thereby reducing 
redundancy and the compliance burden. The provision of the National Floor Wage ensures

uniformity and adequacy nationwide, while the traditional role of ‘Inspector’ is replaced with 
‘Inspector-cum-Facilitator,’ emphasising guidance, awareness, and advisory roles alongside 
enforcement to improve compliance (Code on Wages, 2019). In addition, recognising fixed-
term employment (FTE) as a formal engagement could benefit MSMEs in particular by 
allowing them to hire workers for seasonal or project-based needs without committing to 
long-term employment and incurring overhead costs. It would promote direct hiring over a 
contractual one. According to a study by SBI, the implementation of labour laws can increase 
the formalisation in the economy from 60.4 per cent to 75.5 per cent.72
Impact on employment: The SBI projects medium-term employment gains of 1.0–2.2 
per cent in the organised sector through the implementation of the Labour Codes, resulting 
from reduced compliance costs and expanded formal hiring, though short-term frictions are 
likely. This can lead to a reduction in UR, bringing it down to 1.9- 2.9 per cent and generating 
~77 lakh jobs. Overall, post-transition, unemployment could decrease by 0.3-1.3 per cent, 
depending on the implementation, firm costs, and state policies. Simplified processes 
lower costs for SMEs, enabling scalability, and promote gender-neutral policies (e.g., night 
shifts for women), thereby expanding talent pools. Compliance simplification is expected 
to reduce costs by 30-40 per cent, fostering SME hiring.73 With the higher thresholds for 
layoff, retrenchment, and closure under the Industrial Relations Code, incentives for firms 
to remain small have been reduced. Direct hiring, including FTE, aligns workers with 
organisational goals and encourages employer investment in training, boosting productivity 
and increasing hiring. 
Expansion of social security: CSS mandates aggregators' contribution to 1-2 per cent of 
annual turnover (capped at 5 per cent of worker payouts) to fund life/health insurance, as 
well as pensions for gig workers, potentially covering 2.35 crore workers by 2030. Portable 
benefits via UAN ensure interstate mobility, which is vital for the migrant gig workers. 
These Codes balance worker rights with business ease. For example, Industrial Tribunals 
expedite disputes (from years to months), and the Wages Code's floor wage (₹178-500 daily) 
standardises earnings, curbing exploitation.  
Impact on incomes and growth: These reforms address key challenges, such as income 
volatility and benefit gaps, potentially contributing 1.25 per cent to GDP by 2029-30 through 
enhanced worker welfare and business agility.74 SBI estimates that the implementation of 
the ‘Code on Wages’ would increase the disposable income of workers and has the potential 
to boost consumption by approximately ₹75,000 crore, in turn enhancing economic growth.
Thus, the newly notified Labour Codes hold particular promise for boosting female LFPR, 
enhancing employment and formalisation, spurring inclusive growth and productivity amid 
India's demographic dividend.

Gig economy and informal workforce dynamics
12.34	 India's labour market is transforming due to factors such as economic policies, 
technological progress, and the evolving demands of the labour market. As a result, 
traditional employment paradigms are yielding to hybrid models that blend contract 
and formality. These factors also shape the way key players in the labour market 
interact, specifically the employer and the employee. The changing dynamics of this 
interaction occur in the context of the preferences of these two agents, where one wants 
to maximise its revenue and minimise cost, and the other wants to maximise its pay. 
12.35	 The employer-worker relationship is shaped by factors such as the directness of 
the employer-employee connection (bipartite or tripartite), the nature of work (ongoing 
or task-based), the terms and frequency of payment, the work location and hours, and 
access to benefits such as social security or paid leave. Understanding these features 
is crucial for identifying the diverse categories of workers in India, which range from 
permanent and regular employees to casual, contract, self-employed, and gig workers 
and is essential for framing policies that ensure economic security and fair treatment for 
all in a changing labour market. With the growth of the gig economy, these features are 
evolving further: jobs are more flexible, payments are digital, and traditional employer-
employee interactions are less defined.

12.36	 In general parlance, gig work refers to short-term, task-based or project-based 
work carried out on a freelance or independent basis, often mediated through digital 
platforms. According to the ILO, gig work is typically performed by self-employed or 
independent contractors who obtain clients and projects through online platforms or 
applications and are paid upon completion of tasks or projects rather than receiving 
a regular wage.76 Due to its task-based and independent nature, gig work offers 
flexibility by allowing workers to choose when, where, and how much they work, 
making it particularly attractive to those seeking to balance employment with personal 
responsibilities such as caregiving or education.
12.37	 Against this backdrop, the recent developments in digital platforms and 
policy reforms are reshaping work structures, fostering flexibility while promoting 
formalisation. Gig workers continue to engage on a task-by-task basis with flexible 
hours and pay. The gig economy, encompassing delivery, ridesharing, and freelancing, 
has witnessed structural growth, transitioning informal jobs into ecosystem-integrated 
roles. From 77 lakh workers in FY21, the sector witnessed a 55 per cent increase to 
120 lakh workers in FY25, driven by smartphone penetration among over 80 crore 
users and 15 billion UPI transactions per month. Now representing over 2 per cent of 
the total workforce in India, growth of gig workers outpaces overall employment, with 
non-agricultural gigs projected to constitute 6.7 per cent of the workforce by 2029-30, 
contributing ₹2.35 lakh crore to GDP.77

‘thin-file’ credit access, which remains a concern.78 Platform algorithms control work 
allocation, performance monitoring, wages, and supply-demand matching, raising 
concerns about algorithmic biases and burnout. About 40 per cent of gig workers report 
earnings below ₹15,000 per month.79 Limited skilling and fears of job losses due to 
technological advances such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
add to worker vulnerability. Chapter 14 of the Economic Survey provides a detailed 
examination of the implications of the AI ecosystem for India. Strengthening social 
security, such as provident fund, insurance, and maternity benefits for this sector, is 
essential. 
12.39	 As the gig economy expands, its impact on employment and economic growth will 
become increasingly evident. While it offers unprecedented opportunities for revenue 
creation and economic diversification, addressing its challenges is crucial to ensuring 
long-term and equitable growth. The Labour Codes have formally recognised gig and 
platform workers, expanding social security, welfare funds, and benefit portability.80 
Going forward, ensuring algorithmic transparency and promoting worker-friendly 
practices will be crucial, as highlighted in Box XII.5.
Box XII.5: Balancing regulation and flexibility: 
The new frontiers of the gig workforce
The gig economy is reshaping the labour market by changing the nature of employee-employer 
relations. Gig workers are often classified as ‘freelancers’, ‘independent contractors’ or 
platform partners’, making it difficult to apply conventional labour market definitions and 
regulations. When classified this way, gig workers lack employment benefits such as social 
security, paid leave, minimum hours, and health coverage, resulting in poor job security 
and lower incomes. This is precisely where policy intervention is essential, and the CSS 
steps in by formally recognising gig and platform workers and providing for social security 
schemes for them.81 Chapter I, Section 2(35) of the CSS defines a gig worker as ‘a person who 
participates in a work arrangement and earns from such activities outside of a traditional 
employer–employee relationship.’ It also defines aggregators as digital intermediaries that 
connect service providers with consumers.82
Globally, regulations related to the gig economy are becoming increasingly tightened. In 
2021, Spain introduced the ‘ley rider’ (rider law), recognising food courier workers as employees

rather than self-employed contractors, and establishing rules for the use of algorithms in the 
workplace.83 The European Union Platform Workers' Directive (2024) was implemented 
to correct the employment status of gig workers who are misclassified as self-employed, 
improve transparency, and regulate the use of algorithms and data in decision-making 
processes involving platform workers.84 In 2025, the ILO initiated formal discussions on 
establishing international standards for decent work in the platform economy, with a focus 
on fair wages, working conditions, and social protections.85 Over the years, cities such as 
Seattle86 and New York87 have implemented worker protections, including anti-retaliation 
measures, deactivation appeals, and minimum wage laws, for app-based workers.
Historically, in India, gig and platform workers have been classified as informal labour, 
often not covered by existing labour laws. The CSS provides legal acknowledgement to these 
workers and lays the foundation for establishing their rights and protections.
While the law recognises gig and platform workers as a distinct category, it treats them as a 
largely homogeneous group, whereas in practice the workforce is highly segmented by skill. 
According to a NITI Aayog report, the share of high-skilled gig workers is expected to be 27.5 
per cent by 2030, while for low-skilled workers, it is projected to be 33.8 per cent by 2030. 88 
McKinsey categorises gig workers in the US and EU into four categories based on income 
reliance and preference.89 These included i) Free agents (primary income and prefer gig 
work); ii) Casual earners (gig work for supplementary income or skills); iii) Reluctants (rely 
on gig work but prefer regular jobs), and iv) the financially strapped (gigs to make ends meet). 
While preferences shape the labour supply of gig work, demand is driven by task type and 
skill level, ranging from low-skill-high turnover (jobs like retail, food service, etc) to middle-
skilled generalists (e.g., taxi drivers, beauticians) and highly specialised professionals (e.g., 
programmers, physicians, lawyers) serving multiple employers. Policy should aim to move 
gig workers from categories ‘iii’ and ‘iv’ to ‘i’ and ‘ii’, making gig work a choice rather than 
a necessity. The CSS formally recognises gig workers; policy should now prioritise upward 
mobility of low‑skilled workers through upskilling, move into better-paying jobs, and make 
gig work a stable, reliable income source. 
Another major challenge for gig workers is limited access to credit and productive assets 
needed to move into better gigs. Many cannot upgrade from low- to medium-skilled gigs

because they lack tools (for example, a bike, car, or specialised equipment). Encouraging 
platforms and employers to co-invest in assets and training could help workers progress 
into more secure, higher-quality jobs.90 It is important to help gig workers manage unstable 
incomes. They require basic financial planning support, including access to low-cost 
emergency savings schemes, portable social security benefits, and budgeting or financial-
literacy programmes. The market should be encouraged to offer more flexible and agile 
financial products that consider the income patterns of gig workers.
Platforms have become essential gig-market infrastructure for finding workers and work. 
This concentration of power raises concerns over fees, algorithms, and worker protections. 
Policy should address this through competition rules, data access, and algorithmic 
transparency, while reorganising the social contract so that gig work benefits workers more 
fairly. Policy can reduce the cost gap between regular and gig work by limiting incentives to 
avoid mandatory benefits and by setting minimum per-hour or per-task earnings (including 
waiting time), encouraging formal employment and raising incomes for low- and medium-
skilled gig workers. Taken together, the goal of gig-economy policy should be to reshape the 
terms so that workers exercise real choice rather than being pushed into gigs due to weak 
demand, skill mismatch, or the absence of a safety net.
SKILL ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW
12.40	 Expanding access to skills and improving their quality requires a well-integrated 
skilling ecosystem. Skills policy sits at the crossroads of education, labour markets, and 
industry, making close coordination and collaboration essential among a broad range of 
stakeholders, including multiple institutions, ministries, government at various levels, 
students, educators, workers, employers, trade unions, and other relevant actors. As 
India seeks to harness its demographic dividend and respond to evolving labour market 
needs, a well-integrated and forward-looking skilling system is critical to enabling the 
workforce to capitalise on emerging economic opportunities.
12.41	 The PLFS 2023-24 findings show that the share of individuals (in the 15–59 age 
group) having acquired some form of vocational or technical training has increased 
from 8.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 34.7 per cent in 2023-24, reflecting the positive impact 
of skilling initiatives in India.91 However, there is a need to expand access to formal 
skilling as only 4.9 per cent of the youth (in the 15-29 age group) have received formal 
vocational or technical training, while another 21.2 per cent received training through 
informal sources. Estimates from a 2025 study suggest that a 12-percentage-point 
increase in skilled workforce through investment in formal skilling could lead to more

than a 13 per cent increase in employment in the labour-intensive sectors by 2030.92 
This highlights the need to expand the coverage of skill training programmes while 
ensuring quality and alignment with market demands.
12.42	 As India’s skill landscape expands with a growing working-age population, skilling 
programmes need to work together in a mutually reinforcing way. Internationally, 
countries are shifting towards a whole-of-government approach in skilling that 
enables coordination across ministries (‘horizontal coordination’) and across different 
levels of government (‘vertical coordination’). Many countries have adopted inter-
ministerial platforms and unified governance arrangements to enhance coherence 
while maintaining flexibility for regional and sectoral priorities.93,94 
12.43	 The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) serves as the 
nodal body for national skill development, along with many sectoral skilling schemes 
being designed and implemented independently by other ministries. This presents an 
opportunity for convergence through uniform standards, guidelines, shared platforms, 
and coordinated planning, which can reduce duplication, streamline implementation, 
optimise resource utilisation and enable programmes to operate in a complementary 
manner. Enhanced coordination across ministries and levels of government would 
enable the diverse skilling initiatives to improve employability, expand coverage, and 
better equip the workforce for technological and economic changes.
12.44	 In this regard, the SIDH of the MSDE represents a major governance reform by 
providing a centralised information hub for all government initiatives in the domains 
of skill, education, employment, and entrepreneurship, all in a single portal.95 SIDH 
meets the diverse skilling needs of the labour market by offering digital skilling through 
a learning management system, portable verified credentials and multilingual options 
to ensure inclusivity. It also brings together skilling programmes across central and 
state governments, allowing citizens to choose from multiple skilling options based on 
their preferences. It has streamlined processes such as registration, course delivery, 
credentialing, and job matching, thus reducing duplication across schemes and 
improving administrative efficiency. SIDH data enhances the monitoring of training 
quality and outcomes, supporting evidence-based policy decisions.96 The integration of

industry-aligned courses, including those linked to Industry 4.0, directly connects skill 
training with labour-market demand.
12.45	 Along with enhancing horizontal and vertical coordination, it is also essential to 
redesign the policies to address the evolving needs of the labour market. There is a need 
to shift the focus from outputs, such as the number of programmes and enrolments, 
towards outcomes in terms of employability, improved earnings, and job quality 
(Box XII.6).  
Box XII.6: Making skilling ‘work’ for upskilling and employability
The central challenge in India’s skilling landscape is not the absence of training effort but 
the weak translation of training into durable labour-market value. Making skilling truly 
work requires a shift in both mindset and mechanics: from producing trained persons to 
producing workers whose skills are valued, verified and retained.
The first step is to re-anchor incentives around outcomes and retention. Training 
providers, intermediaries and even public agencies respond to the signals that funding and 
compliance systems send them. If payments, renewals and reputational credibility are tied 
primarily to numbers trained, the rational behaviour of the system will be to maximise 
throughput. If contracts and empanelment hinge on verified employment starts, six- and 
twelve-month retention, and evidence of earnings uplift relative to the baseline, the system 
begins to reorganise itself around placement quality, realistic counselling, closer employer 
partnerships, and post-placement support. This reframing also influences course choices: 
modules that consistently fail to lead to jobs or apprenticeships are no longer attractive to 
providers and are gradually removed from the portfolio. The section on innovative financing 
mechanisms builds on this approach by examining outcome-based instruments such as skill 
impact bonds of the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and skill vouchers.
A second ingredient is to treat employer linkage as a core design feature rather than 
an add-on. Skilling programmes perform best when employers are involved at three key 
points: in shaping curricula so that skills align with actual tasks and equipment, in creating 
workplace learning opportunities through apprenticeships or internships, and in jointly 
participating in assessment, ensuring that certification signals competence rather than 
attendance. This is especially important in India’s labour market, which remains dominated 
by small and informal firms with limited human resource capabilities; without such linkage, 
trainees may complete courses only to discover that their skills are either mismatched or 
undervalued. The section titled 'Supply-Driven to Industry-Driven Skilling' elaborates on 
how skill initiatives in India are strengthening these linkages.
Third, local labour market intelligence must inform course portfolios. The failure 
of many skilling efforts lies less in the quality of training than in an inappropriate mix of 
courses relative to district-level demand. A dynamic mapping of vacancies, investment 
pipelines, migration corridors and sectoral shifts can inform which roles merit expansion 
and which should be sunset. Short, stackable modules that allow workers to accumulate

capabilities over time, including through recognition of prior learning, can support mobility 
and wage progression rather than creating a brittle one-shot credential.
Fourth, placement must be professionalised as a service. Counselling that clarifies 
aptitude, wage expectations and likely job locations is essential to avoid disillusionment and 
premature quitting. Verified interview pipelines, job fairs with real openings, and mobility 
support for inter-district or inter-state placements can materially improve retention. In 
many cases, small frictions, such as the cost of relocation, a lack of accommodation, or weak 
social support, undermine otherwise sound training-to-job transitions. Acknowledging and 
addressing these realities is part of making skilling effective. 
Fifth, the credibility of the entire enterprise depends on integrity in attendance, 
assessment and verification. When ghost centres, inflated numbers or weak assessments 
creep in, they erode trust among employers, trainees and the public, and crowd out more 
sincere providers. Strong digital attendance with audit trails, third-party assessment 
integrity checks and transparent grievance redress processes are not administrative 
niceties; they are foundational to establishing the signal value of a certificate. The section 
titled ‘From challenges to accountability via skilling scorecard’ highlights the importance of 
strengthening assessment and accountability frameworks in the skill ecosystem.
Within this broader effort to improve employability, the question arises whether upgrading 
Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) diplomas into bachelor-level degrees would 
help to make vocational pathways more attractive and valued. There are two distinct 
effects to consider. On the positive side, degree-equivalent recognition can enhance the 
reputation and social prestige of vocational tracks in a country where families often equate 
degrees with status and opportunities. It may also enhance academic mobility, enabling 
lateral entry into higher education, professional certifications or engineering pathways 
that were previously closed to vocational graduates. For some trainees, this can reduce the 
perceived risk of choosing a skills-first route. Box XII.9 highlights the success of Odisha’s 
skill development initiatives in strengthening ITIs and short-term training programmes by 
reshaping perceptions around skilling, offering a replicable template for other states.
A prudent approach is to view the degree upgrade as a complementary instrument, 
not a substitute for outcome-oriented reform. Where ITI programmes already demonstrate 
strong employer linkage, workplace learning and high retention, a degree-equivalent 
qualification can reinforce status and mobility. Where these conditions are absent, changing 
the credentials risks cosmetic improvement without real gains in employability. The test 
of success should remain the same: higher and more sustained employment, better match 
quality, and measurable earnings trajectories for graduates. 
In sum, making skilling work in India requires aligning institutional incentives, employer 
partnerships, course portfolios, placement services, and integrity mechanisms around the 
lived outcomes of trainees. If this alignment is achieved, the attractiveness and dignity 
of skills-based pathways, whether labelled diplomas or degrees, will follow from their 
demonstrated value in the labour market rather than from optics alone.

SKILLING STRATEGIES FOR YOUTH 
12.46	 The aspirational youth of the country need to be equipped to navigate the 
evolving dynamics of the job market. For building a skilled workforce, there is a felt 
need for vocational education to start early, as strong foundational skills can enable 
young people to acquire new skills, adapt to technologies, and progress over time. The 
Economic Survey 2024-25 highlighted the mismatch between educational attainment 
and occupational skill requirements, underscoring the need to integrate vocational 
education within the schooling system, enabling the development of relevant skills from 
an early stage and fostering an efficient alignment between education and labour market 
requirements.97 The importance of early exposure to skills has also been highlighted in 
Chapter 11 of the Economic Survey. 
12.47	 Vocational education and training constitute a critical component of the 
education-employment interface, equipping individuals with occupation-specific 
skills required for effective labour market participation. By aligning learning with 
labour-market needs, vocational tracks have the potential to enhance employment 
prospects, facilitate smoother school-to-work (STW) transitions, strengthen workforce 
participation, and reduce unemployment, thereby contributing to broader economic 
and social development outcomes. 
12.48	 A 2025 National Skill Gap Study indicates that India still experiences a skill 
mismatch caused by several factors, such as weak foundational skills, a mismatch 
between industry needs and the training provided, and the inability to adapt to 
emerging technologies and processes.98 Research suggests that school curricula focused 
on academic and college-preparatory tracks can lead to weaker STW transitions, skills 
mismatches, and differentiated outcomes. The returns to vocational education are 
higher compared to those of general education at the secondary level, and students 
who already express a preference for the vocational track experience greater benefits 
from vocational education at the upper-secondary stage.99,100,101  For India, the PARAKH 
Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024 findings show that only 47 per cent of schools offer skill-
based courses at grade IX and above, and that participation remains low (29 per 
cent). Taken together, the evidence suggests that a narrow academic focus can lead to 
unintended outcomes, highlighting the need to integrate broader vocational learning 
into general education from an early stage.

12.49	 A World Bank Report highlights the need to develop effective strategies to 
enhance STW transition programmes. It suggests that agriculture and services are 
two key sectors with high potential for job creation. In the agricultural sector, the job 
opportunities have been identified in input companies, agro-processing supervisor, 
and advisory roles, all of which require high employability skills. Similarly, the service 
sector offers significant opportunities in retail, IT, banking, and other roles that require 
a multi-skilled approach.102,103 Given this landscape, strengthening skilling at an early 
stage is essential to ensure that young people are equipped to fully benefit from this 
emerging job potential. Box XII.7 discusses this aspect.
Box XII.7:  From classroom to career: How early vocational 
education can transform India’s skilling landscape
Embedding vocational exposure within schooling has demonstrated how early, well-
structured pathways can align education with evolving labour-market needs. Models from 
Germany, China, South Korea, Australia, Switzerland, and the USA illustrate this approach, 
revealing common structural features that underpin effective vocational pathways.
A review of international experience shows that effective vocational initiatives at the school 
level exhibit several common structural features. First, vocational orientation begins early. 
For example, Germany’s differentiated lower-secondary structure, China’s post-lower-
secondary bifurcation into general and vocational tracks, Australia’s vocational options 
soon after seven years of compulsory primary education, and the USA’s high-school level 
Career and Technical Education, all introduce students to occupational choices at an early 
stage.104 Second, these countries rely on strong dual or hybrid models that integrate school-
based instruction with workplace training, as seen in Germany’s dual system, Switzerland’s 
arrangement where adolescents alternate between three to four days of apprenticeship and 
one to two days of classroom learning, and South Korea’s Industry-Academy Integrated 
Apprenticeship Schools where high school students undertake a two-year apprenticeship 
beginning in their first year.105 Third, industry participation is extensive, with employers 
contributing to curriculum design in all these systems, and German firms also paying 
apprenticeship wages and co-financing programmes.106 Fourth, government support 
mechanisms play a key role, including China’s tuition waivers and subsidies, Korea’s 
structured employment-support services, and Australia’s flexible qualification frameworks. 
Finally, these systems ensure flexible education routes, such as Korea’s ‘Job First, University 
Later’ model and Germany’s provisions granting vocational graduates access to general or

subject-specific higher education.107 Overall, these features underscore that strong vocational 
pathways within schools are shaped by early skill education, coordinated school-workplace 
training, sustained industry involvement, strong policy support, and flexibility between 
educational routes.
Some states in India have also taken steps to strengthen vocational education within schools. 
Under the Strengthening Teaching-Learning and Results for States (STARS) programme 
supported by the World Bank, some states have introduced a range of initiatives to 
strengthen STW transitions.108 Madhya Pradesh’s Skill GPS app, Rajasthan’s Comprehensive 
Career Education Programme, and Maharashtra’s Career Portal together expand data-
driven career guidance and counselling for students in grades IX-XII.109 Odisha enhances 
experiential learning through structured industrial visits, mapping nearby industries 
to ensure regular exposure to real work environments. Kerala’s ESTEEM initiative and 
Himachal Pradesh’s skill labs further support vocational training for targeted cohorts, such 
as learners with special needs and out-of-school youth. Meghalaya is enhancing vocational 
orientation through programmes that equip students with career-ready skills. Across 183 
schools, more than 15,000 students in grades IX and X receive project-based training in IT, 
electronics, beauty and wellness, tourism, and plumbing, supported by digital tracking on 
the PRABANDH (Project Appraisal, Budgeting, Achievements and Data Handling System) 
portal.110  These interventions aim to ensure that students gain both technical familiarity 
and applied learning experience during their formative years. Complementing these efforts 
is SPARK (School Programmes in Articulation, Resilience and Kindness) launched in 2024 
by the Meghalaya government to strengthen students’ communication, resilience, and 
emotional well-being.111 Targeting grades VIII, IX and X, SPARK empowered 6,048 students 
across 28 institutions, logging 1,20,960 training hours in its pilot year (4 April 2024 – 20 
June 2025).112
The government is implementing the Vocationalisation of School Education scheme under 
the Samagra Shiksha scheme for integrated school education aligned with the National 
Education Policy (NEP) 2020.113 The scheme seeks to integrate vocational learning with 
general academic education to develop educated, employable and competitive individuals 
for a changing economy. The Employability Skills module, which covers communication, 
self-management, ICT, entrepreneurship and green skills, has been made mandatory across 
vocational courses. The CBSE has also introduced early vocational exposure by mandating 
Skill Education in grades VI-VIII, starting from the 2025-26 academic year, through the 
NCERT Kaushal Bodh textbooks. Schools are required to adopt a project-based learning

approach that engages students in hands-on work across different domains, utilising 
available Composite Skill Labs, relevant tools, and support from local experts.114  To reinforce 
experiential learning, schools are also encouraged to organise an annual Kaushal Mela (Skill 
Fair) to showcase students’ projects and the skills acquired during the year.
Strengthening vocational education at the school level requires ensuring that curriculum 
structures allow adequate time for hands-on, project-based activities along with general 
education. This can be supported through enhanced teacher preparation, improved school 
equipment, and structured opportunities to build students’ social and self-management 
skills. Schools also need access to suitable resources and flexible learning spaces for 
vocational training. Engagement with industry resource persons and community skill 
partners can enhance the practical relevance of learning and familiarise students with real 
work contexts. Additionally, creating spaces and platforms within schools for showcasing 
skills and reflecting on learning can make vocational education aspirational across the school 
ecosystem. Collectively, such measures will ensure that vocational learning is meaningfully 
integrated into schooling, creating a stronger pipeline of skill-ready learners.
12.50	 Just like school education, vocational education in the higher-education 
ecosystem has also undergone a series of reforms aimed at improving flexibility 
and industry alignment. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) has enabled the 
accumulation and transfer of credits across academic, vocational, and work-based 
learning routes, thereby expanding mobility for students and improving the integration 
of skill-based components within degree programmes.115 Further, the operationalisation 
of multiple entry-exit provisions allows learners to re-enter higher education with prior 
credits and accumulate qualifications in a modular manner. Additionally, the expansion 
of apprenticeship-embedded undergraduate degrees has strengthened industry 
linkages by incorporating structured on-the-job training into the curricula. Further, 
the launch of SWAYAM Plus in February 2024 has facilitated the delivery of industry-
aligned digital courses in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, 
and robotics.116  The National Apprenticeship Training Scheme (NATS) 2.0 has scaled 
apprenticeship support through over 12 lakh DBT stipend transfers.117 Collectively, 
these measures reflect an ongoing transition toward a more flexible, modular, and

labour-market-responsive education framework. More details are presented in Box 
XII.8.
Box XII.8: Future-ready workforce through apprenticeships
Positioned at the intersection of formal education and on-the-job learning, apprenticeships 
offer young people hands-on experience, improve employability, and enable smoother STW 
transitions. As India accelerates towards a knowledge-driven and technology-intensive 
economy, the apprenticeship system is being reimagined to integrate new-age trades, 
align with global standards, and respond to the dynamic needs of industry. The goal is to 
design an apprenticeship system that balances benefits for employers and apprentices by 
setting high yet sustainable wages, ensuring high-quality on- and off-the-job training, and 
structuring work placements to allow employers to recover training costs while apprentices 
build advanced skills.118
Accordingly, the apprenticeship ecosystem has undergone a policy and structural 
transformation. The National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) and NATS have 
been expanded to cover a wider range of sectors and enterprises. Over 43.47 lakh apprentices 
have been engaged under PM-NAPS across 36 states/UTs, with participation from more 
than 51,000 establishments, and female participation reaching 20 per cent.119 The NATS 
programme also recorded engagement of 5.23 lakh apprentices in FY25, demonstrating the 
expanding scale and institutional maturity of India’s apprenticeship framework.120 
Despite this momentum, certain systemic challenges continue to hinder the full potential 
of the apprenticeship framework. Under the NAPS, over 6,100 enterprises are actively 
engaged in apprenticeship training, with over 9.9 lakh apprentices enrolled in  FY26.121 This 
represents a small fraction of the 5.2 lakh registered SMEs in the country.122 If each of these 
SMEs were to enrol even two apprentices, the total number of apprentices could increase by 
over 10 lakh. The limited number of active establishments underscores the need to increase 
awareness of the scheme among industry partners, particularly SMEs.123
Additionally, the presence of multiple overlapping programmes, such as NAPS and NATS, 
with responsibility split between the MSDE and the Ministry of Education, makes it difficult 
for industry players to navigate the different processes and portals, resulting in a compliance

burden.124 Regional disparities also persist in candidate registrations across states. While 
Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh report over 10 lakh registered apprentices each, many 
North-Eastern states have only a few hundred to a few thousand registrations.125
To address these gaps, a unified apprenticeship mission may be needed to bring NAPS, 
NATS, and similar schemes under a single framework, ensuring better policy alignment 
and closer integration between education, skilling, and employment.126 Strengthening 
District Skill Committees as local anchors can enable targeted outreach in states with 
low registrations, aspirational districts, and the North-Eastern region. Building on the 
pilot apprenticeship initiative in the North-Eastern Region, there is need to scale similar 
efforts to increase participation by establishments and apprentices across other regions.127 
Apprenticeship opportunities should also expand into new-age and gig economy sectors, 
including green manufacturing, logistics, and digital services, to meet emerging industry 
demands. Finally, enhanced industry participation can be encouraged through MSME 
cluster models and graded incentives tailored to companies based on their size.128 There is 
a need to ensure continuity and support for apprentices by providing insurance coverage, 
travel and accommodation assistance, and linkages to post-apprenticeship employment or 
entrepreneurship schemes, making participation safer and more rewarding. Additionally, 
strengthening recognition of prior learning under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 
(PMKVY) by linking it to formal learning pathways will allow apprentices to receive credit 
for their existing skills and experience, promoting lifelong skill development and mobility. 129 
By driving unified governance, localised implementation, and industry partnerships, India 
can transform its apprenticeship ecosystem to meet the evolving needs of the labour market 
and promote inclusivity, security, and aspiration. The convergence of policy reforms, 
institutional coordination, and industry engagement will position apprenticeships as a 
strategic lever for generating sustainable employment.
Supply-driven to industry-driven skilling
12.51	 As learners advance, education and vocational pathways must be closely 
aligned with industry, ensuring that curricula, pedagogy, and assessment reflect the 
real-world requirements and evolving demands of the workplace. Industry-driven 
skilling has become central to effective workforce development. Industry involvement 
in curricula, training, apprenticeships, and assessments aims to make skilling more 
market-responsive. Embedding industry participation across institutions, standards, 
and programme oversight can enhance the relevance and credibility of training.

12.52	 In recognition of this, under PMKVY 4.0, training is imparted in NSQF-aligned 
job roles developed by industry-led Sector Skill Councils (SSC), and several courses are 
delivered directly within industrial premises with trainers sourced from the employer 
ecosystem.130 Furthermore, regular Rozgar Melas and National Apprenticeship Melas 
enhance the interface between employers and job seekers.  Under PMKVY 4.0, the 
sectoral focus on digital technologies, green energy, healthcare, advanced agriculture, 
financial services, and e-commerce reflects a calibrated effort to steer skilling 
investments toward India’s long-term growth drivers and emerging opportunities in 
the global economy.
12.53	 Mechanisms such as the Flexi-MoU scheme further support this shift by allowing 
firms to customise training and introduce courses aligned with their evolving skill needs. 
Prominent enterprises have been onboarded as industrial training partners, enabling 
the training of nearly 10,000 trainees so far. 
12.54	 Complementing firm-led training models, industry and market linkages are also 
being strengthened for traditional occupations through the PM Vishwakarma Kaushal 
Samman Yojana, launched in September 2023. The scheme aims to uplift the lives 
of traditional artisans and craftsperson by enhancing their skills and increasing the 
reach of their products and services. It seeks to provide end-to-end holistic support to 
artisans and craftspeople of 18 traditional trades who work with their hands and tools. 
As of 1 December 2025, 30 lakh beneficiaries have been registered, out of which 23.09 
lakh beneficiaries have been trained.131 Beneficiaries receive a PM Vishwakarma digital 
certificate and ID, enabling access to all scheme benefits, including skill upgradation, tool 
kit incentives (e-voucher up to ₹15,000), digital transaction incentives, and collateral-
free loans up to ₹3 lakh at concessional interest rates.132 Also, online marketing support 
is being provided to PM Vishwakarma beneficiaries through various e-commerce 
platforms to promote the sale of their products in the domestic as well as international 
markets. Additionally, over 30,000 Vishwakarma beneficiaries have been successfully 
onboarded on the Government e-Marketplace, enhancing their access to institutional 
buyers.

digital content, and industry-aligned long- and short-term courses.133 In addition, 
the establishment of five sector-specific National Centres of Excellence for advanced 
training of trainers in partnership with global institutions would further enhance 
skill training. Implementation through special-purpose vehicles with anchor industry 
partners will enable outcome-based training and stronger industry linkages. Further, 
the NSQF-compliant training has been expanded by developing 169 trades, which 
include 31 future-skills courses in areas such as AI, internet of things (IoT), renewable 
energy and 3D printing, delivered through the nationwide network of ITIs and National 
Skill Training Institutes.134 Together, these measures aim to reposition ITIs as modern, 
industry-integrated institutions that deliver high-quality, demand-driven vocational 
training. In this regard, the success achieved in Odisha can offer valuable lessons for 
others. These are presented in Box XII.9.
Box XII.9: Strengthening Industrial Training Institutes: 
Lessons from Odisha’s success
Improving employability through skilling initiatives and developing the required skill 
infrastructure has been a key priority of the government. The ITIs are foundational for 
achieving this.  Over the years, a series of steps have been taken to revamp ITIs. These 
include the Centres of Excellence scheme, STRIVE funding, ITI grading, and mandatory 
Institute Management Committees. Despite these efforts, underutilisation of capacity, 
subpar training quality, faculty capabilities, and infrastructure that fall short of global 
benchmarks, as well as limited employability and entrepreneurial preparedness among 
most trainees, persist.135
Odisha started its skill transformation with the establishment of the Odisha Skill 
Development Authority (OSDA) in 2016.  The mission of the OSDA was to ‘Skill in Odisha’. 
For that, it followed a simple strategy, ‘Fix, Accelerate, Scale.’ The idea was to ‘fix’ the ITIs, 
‘scale’ the short-term training programmes and ‘accelerate’ the setting up of advanced 
training institutes. At the core of this strategy was converging ongoing skill initiatives across 
departments, ensuring quality standards, and developing market-responsive training, 
inclusivity, and scalability.
Fixing the ITI 
The strategy aimed to address key challenges, including the underutilization of ITIs and the 
lack of necessary infrastructure. The Odisha model addressed the demand slack by focusing 
on the perception of vocational education and ITIs. A role model campaign using the ‘10-6-
4-2’ formula focused on highlighting alumni success (10 successful alumni- six of whom are 
employed out of Odisha, four are women, and two are entrepreneurs). Confidence-building 
was done through changes in uniforms, ITI fests, and through global exposure.

The key elements of the model such as image reinvention, alumni engagement, and success 
stories- are learnings that can be adapted by other states. Such campaigns can contribute 
to changing public perception, boosting enrolment, and improving employer connections. 
Going forward, at the district level, local ITIs and polytechnics should be revamped in a 
substantial, visible, and aspirational manner, making them attractive for students.   
Scaling short-term training expansion: 
To strengthen the supply side, short-term skilling programmes such as Deen Dayal 
Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) were scaled up in both volume and 
quality. Efforts were focused on improving trainee well-being at training centres, expanding 
outreach in rural areas, and using alumni role models to raise awareness. Urban events were 
organised to celebrate skilled workers and shift social perceptions about vocational training. 
Information gaps about future work pathways were addressed by highlighting examples 
such as DDU-GKY-trained sewing machine operators employed in Tata Aerospace for 
aircraft manufacturing.
Efforts to scale short-term training courses should prioritise raising awareness of the benefits 
and returns of skilling, improving trainee mobilisation, and elevating trainer standards.
Courses must align with local labour market demands, backed by trainer development and 
performance-based incentives.
Accelerate the establishment of the Advanced Training Institute
The third arm of the strategy was to establish a world-class training institute in collaboration 
with the Institute of Technical Education - Education Services (ITEES), Singapore,136 
though the initial target was to establish eight of these. The Odisha World Skill Centre 
in Bhubaneswar, inaugurated in 2021, features Schools of Engineering and Services. It 
offers scholarships, training from basic to advanced levels (including safety and life skills), 
and leverages ITEES collaboration for teacher training. Similar centres, built with robust 
industry and international partnerships, can function as apex skilling institutions.
Taken together, the ‘Fix; Scale; Accelerate’ approach, inspired by Odisha’s experience137, 
provides an adaptable template for strengthening the skill ecosystem and ITIs, transforming 
them from underutilised institutions into aspirational, high-quality institutions that can 
strengthen India’s skill ecosystem. 
Innovative financing mechanisms for skill development	
12.56	 As skilling gains priority, public funding alone is insufficient to meet diverse 
needs, highlighting the need for alternative mechanisms. Varied and uncertain returns 
to skill investments combined with market failures, such as information gaps and credit 
constraints, hinder skill acquisition, underscoring the need for government-designed

financing models that expand access, encourage private sector participation, and ensure 
broad-based economic benefits.138
12.57	 Under NAPS 2.0, the government now transfers 25 per cent of the prescribed 
stipend directly to apprentices through DBT enhancing transparency, reducing 
administrative burden, and improving cash-flow predictability for establishments. As 
of 31 October 2025, an amount of ₹1,110.64 crore has been released as stipend support 
directly to apprentices under this framework.
12.58	 International experience suggests that loan systems can incorporate incentives 
that encourage learners to pursue skill training or occupations aligned with national 
priorities.139 Designing such systems with appropriate incentives can help ensure 
expanding access to skill training. In India, the modified Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme 
for Skill Development (CGFSSD), operationalised as the Model Skill Loan Scheme 
in 2024, aims to strengthen the credit-based route for skill acquisition by increasing 
the maximum loan limit and expanding the pool of eligible lending institutions.140 
The scheme also extends coverage to non-NSQF courses offered by training entities 
registered on MSDE’s SIDH. 
12.59	 Beyond traditional grants and credit-based instruments, outcomes-based 
financing models offer a complementary approach to mobilising private capital while 
retaining public accountability. India’s Skill Impact Bond (SIB), implemented by MSDE 
through NSDC, demonstrates how performance-linked payment mechanisms can align 
public objectives with private investment by linking funding to independently verified 
placement and retention outcomes. By de-risking private participation and rewarding 
sustained employment rather than enrolments alone, such models can expand the 
financing envelope for skilling while incentivising quality, employer alignment, and 
long-term labour-market impact.141
12.60	 Other than government financing, co-investing in training through mandatory 
or voluntary contributions by employers offers an alternative approach to financing 
skill development. It is used in countries such as Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, 
Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Singapore, and 
Spain.142 Ireland’s Skillnet training networks bring together private firms to undertake

collaborative training activities that are otherwise difficult to implement individually. 
A broad network of Skillnet groups across Ireland is funded by the government and 
the National Training Fund, with support from employer contributions. These models 
help address sector-specific skill gaps while ensuring deeper employer engagement in 
the skilling ecosystem.143 Similarly, in India, employers support workforce training. For 
example, certain companies provide paid education leave and sponsor higher education 
for permanent employees, while IT firms often fund online courses and training 
programmes.144 The SSCs under NSDC further facilitate industry-led investments 
in skill development, helping address sector-specific gaps and strengthen employer 
engagement. In FY25, almost 1.13 lakh candidates were trained through industry 
funding under SSCs.145
12.61	 Learner choice, quality, and affordability are vital to effective vocational 
education. Allowing learners more control over course selection can enhance 
engagement and completion rates. At the same time, social and institutional factors 
may limit participation, emphasising the need for inclusivity. Maintaining high quality 
is crucial for the credibility and relevance of training, while affordability ensures access 
and informed choices. Together, these factors create a more inclusive and balanced 
vocational skilling system. Box XII.10 discusses how skill vouchers can be an effective 
lever in exercising individual choice for skilling.
Box XII.10: Skill vouchers: Making training systems more 
flexible, fair, and future-ready 
Skill vouchers represent a promising alternative to financing skill development. This is a 
demand-side financing instrument that enables trainees to choose their preferred courses 
and encourages competition among training providers to offer higher-quality programmes. 
The learner chooses the course, contributes a small co-payment, and the training institute 
redeems the voucher for payment upon meeting specified performance criteria.146
Skill vouchers have been successfully implemented in various formats in countries such 
as Singapore, Germany, the USA, Australia, and Kenya. They can be designed as targeted 
interventions, as seen in Germany’s Training Voucher Programme147, the United States’ 
Trade Adjustment Assistance programme148  and Kenya’s Technical and Vocational Vouchers

these programmes provide trainees with autonomy to choose their training institute and 
programme. Non-redemption is not penalised; instead, the unused voucher simply lapses. 
This ensures that trainees only enrol in courses that match their expectations, while 
encouraging training institutes to maintain and improve the quality of their programmes. 
Evidence suggests that the provision of appropriate counselling, assessment, and the 
availability of performance information are essential for the success of the programmes.151,152 
In India, both state governments and civil society organisations have implemented skill-
voucher initiatives. The Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department of the government of 
Tamil Nadu launched a skill voucher scheme in 2024 for Adi Dravidar, Tribal, and Christian 
Adi Dravidar students who pass their graduation, post-graduation, and technical courses 
with 60 per cent or more marks.153 Under the scheme, eligible students received vouchers 
valued at ₹12,000, ₹15,000, or ₹25,000 to enrol in training programmes in emerging fields, 
offered by training institutions listed on approved platforms. 
In Maharashtra’s Vikalp Skill Voucher Programme, redeemable skill vouchers were provided, 
allowing students to select accredited training institutes. Payments to trainers were linked 
to specific outcomes, including course completion, certification, and job placement.154 The 
model enhanced cost efficiency, strengthened trainee commitment and ownership, and 
achieved a job-retention rate of 60 per cent among those who completed the training within 
the prescribed time.155
These initiatives and international experience provide valuable lessons in designing 
inclusive, accountable, and effective skill voucher programmes. For states implementing 
these programmes, expanding vouchers beyond targeted groups and conducting regular 
impact assessments would provide valuable insights for scaling, enhancing choice, equity, 
and overall effectiveness across the skilling ecosystem. In addition, empanelment of training 
providers based on quality standards, combined with performance-based monitoring, 
ensures that meaningful outcomes are achieved.

mismatches that vocational training alone cannot remedy.156 These gaps are 
compounded by regional disparities in employability (Northern and Southern states 
performing better), demographic disparities (the 22–25 age group dominates youth 
employability), and low overall employability (56.3 per cent).157
12.63	 Furthermore, weak technical and vocational education and training (TVET) 
quality, resulting from inadequately trained instructors, outdated curricula, and 
limited practical exposure, means that even certified candidates often fail to meet 
firms’ expectations. Local skilling remains inadequately aligned with industry 
needs, traditional sectors (such as weaving, dairy and entry-level manufacturing) 
are perceived as low status and not well-paid, and youth wage aspirations frequently 
exceed what firms can offer, resulting in high early turnover and limited adaptability 
to rapid technological change.158 Infrastructure gaps, insufficient industry-academia 
collaboration, and financial limitations further compound these challenges.159 Within 
this broader context, PMKVY faces significant implementation challenges, including 
inconsistencies in beneficiary and data management, delays in disbursing funds, gaps 
in monitoring systems, and low placement outcomes.160
12.64	 The chapter has already discussed solutions like programme convergence, 
early vocational education, strengthening industry linkages, and alternative financing. 
However, a comprehensive evaluation of the skilling system is essential to benchmark 
performance across regions, enforce outcome metrics, and drive demand-led reforms. 
Evaluation of skill initiatives must move beyond compliance-based metrics such as 
enrolments and certifications, towards assessing whether skilling programmes generate 
sustained labour-market value in terms of employability, earnings, and job retention. 
Critically, evaluation should follow the trainee’s post-training trajectory rather than 
the administrative cycle of the scheme. The third-party assessments of flagship 
schemes, such as PMKVY, Jan Shiksha Sansthan, ITIs, and NAPS, indicate positive 
outcomes in terms of trainee income, placements, and employer demand.161 Most of 
these evaluations date back to 2020-21. Given rapid technological change and evolving

local labour-market demand, a fresh and outcome-oriented reassessment, anchored in 
medium-term employment and earnings outcomes, is therefore essential. 
12.65	 The integration of SIDH, NCS and e-Shram portal has created a robust digital 
infrastructure that can be leveraged for real-time monitoring and assessment, linking 
training records with employment outcomes, employer demand, and individual skilling 
trajectories. This infrastructure can enable the continuous tracking of individual trainees, 
beginning with baseline profiles that capture prior education (through integration of 
APAAR IDs 162) and work history, and location. This profile must be followed through the 
training and employment cycle, including certification, placement, or apprenticeship, as 
well as six- and twelve-month employment and earnings outcomes. Further integration 
with platforms like PM Vishwakarma, EPFO, ESIC, etc, can provide greater insights 
into the trajectory of unorganised and traditional workers. Such integration would 
support evidence-based reassessment of schemes, improve targeting, and better align 
training supply with labour-market needs. 
12.66	 Mature skilling and apprenticeship systems across Europe and East Asia converge 
on three evaluation habits that India can adapt rather than copy mechanically. First, they 
measure employment and wage outcomes longitudinally. In Singapore’s adult learning 
system, for instance, training cohorts are tracked for post-course employability and 
wage effects, and the publication of these indicators shapes future course design and 
budget allocation.163 Second, in the dual-system traditions of Germany and Switzerland, 
employers are structurally embedded in curriculum definition, workplace learning and 
assessment, which creates a natural outcome-monitoring loop because firms have direct 
stakes in trainee capability and retention.164 Third, in countries such as Korea, active 
labour-market programmes are treated as policy instruments that must continually 
justify scale, with periodic reviews that prune weak interventions and expand strong 
ones.165 The transferable lesson is not that a single institutional model guarantees 
success, but that systems which consistently generate value do so by linking funding, 
course portfolios and institutional legitimacy to measured outcomes over time.
12.67	 In India, longitudinal tracking of trainees through their UAN, which can be used 
for EPFO, ESIC, and other social security schemes, would enable the measurement 
of long-term impact. Outcome-linked financing could further incentivise training 
quality, allowing high-performing institutions to expand while phasing out those with 
low demand. A comprehensive data-driven scorecard system that tracks employment

outcomes, retention, earnings, and training quality can guide policy decisions and help 
learners make informed choices, ensuring more efficient and effective utilisation of 
skilling resources. 
OUTLOOK
12.68	 India has recorded significant employment growth in recent years, supported 
by structural reforms, tax rationalisation, and a sustained focus on skill development. 
Measures such as deregulation, GST 2.0, and labour reforms implemented by states 
have contributed to rising labour force participation and employment growth across 
industry and services.
12.69	 The employment and skilling ecosystem is being reshaped by demographic 
shifts, technological change, and evolving industry needs, including the expansion 
of gig and platform work. Amid these developments, the effective implementation of 
Labour Codes would play a key role in supporting formal employment and improving 
security for women and gig workers. As definitions of work continue to evolve, dynamic 
labour policy and flexible regulatory frameworks would ensure employment expansion, 
worker security and well-being. 
12.70	 On the skills front, flexible vocational pathways starting at the school level will 
be required, going forward. Recent skilling initiatives reflect a shift towards a more 
modular and labour-market-responsive framework, helping reduce skill mismatches 
and support employment generation. Targeted skilling for women and youth in high-
productivity sectors will be critical for inclusive outcomes.
12.71	 As India moves ahead in its growth journey, advancing institutional 
convergence and fostering a whole-of-government approach would enable the skilling 
and employment initiatives to operate in a coherent manner. The development of an 
information system that brings together data from e-Shram on unorganised workers, 
NCS on job vacancies and required skills, and SIDH on training opportunities can lay 
the foundation for an integrated digital public infrastructure. This could set the stage 
for a sharper emphasis on industry-driven skilling, which remains central to building 
job-ready talent and strengthening skill-industry linkages.
