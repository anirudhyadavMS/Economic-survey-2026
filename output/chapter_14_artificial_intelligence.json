    "This page has been left blank",
    "This chapter examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global economy and outlines a pragmatic strategy for India in an environment marked by rapid technological change and persistent uncertainty. The chapter argues that India’s AI strategy should be grounded in its own economic realities, rather than attempting to replicate unsustainable models adopted in advanced economies.",
    "Given the constraints related to capital, computing capacity, energy, and infrastructure, pursuing scale for its own sake is neither efficient nor necessary.",
    "Instead, the chapter makes the case that a bottom-up, multiple sector-specific approaches under a single vision has the potential to pay dividends and turn into a source of dignified employment for India’s youth. India’s development of AI must be grounded in open and interoperable systems to promote collaboration and shared innovation. This pathway aligns more closely with India’s strengths in human capital, data diversity and institutional coordination.",
    "On governance, the chapter emphasises sequencing, enabling experimentation first, scaling next, and introducing binding obligations only where risks and asymmetries are most pronounced. The proposed framework for data governance strikes a balance between openness to cross-border flows and strengthening accountability and regulatory visibility. It is rooted in the objective of ensuring that the value accruing from India’s domestic data is retained within the country for the benefit of the people. The government’s role is framed as that of an enabler and coordinator, helping markets and institutions adjust in step with technological change.",
    "Overall, the chapter treats AI as a strategic choice. The central message is that",
    "India’s opportunity lies in deploying AI in a way that is economically grounded and socially responsive.",

Explanatory variables include the average hourly wages in the sector, the federal funds rate to account for the cost of borrowing, a monthly real GDP series created by S&P, and the consumer price index.

At the same time, the interaction between the post-2022 regime indicator and real GDP is negative and statistically significant across both time-horizons. This implies that relative to pre-2022, the marginal responsiveness of PBIS sector employment to output growth is lower in post-2022 regime."
