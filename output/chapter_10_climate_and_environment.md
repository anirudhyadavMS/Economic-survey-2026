9.62 	 At the same time, the concept of infrastructure is evolving beyond physical 
networks to encompass digital public infrastructure, clean energy systems, resilient 
water management and future-ready technologies. This widened infrastructure base 
is also enhancing productivity, competitiveness, innovation and sustainability across 
the economy. Looking ahead, maintaining investment momentum, deepening private 
participation and aligning infrastructure development with emerging priorities—such 
as decarbonisation, digitalisation and resilience—will be critical. Together, these efforts 
position infrastructure as a central pillar of India’s medium-term growth strategy and 
a key enabler of its long-term development vision under Viksit Bharat @2047.

CHANGE: BUILDING  
A RESILIENT, COMPETITIVE 
AND DEVELOPMENT-DRIVEN 
INDIA
India aims to become a developed nation by 2047, which requires achieving 
high, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable growth. This will necessitate a 
transformation in consumption and production patterns, as well as technological 
and policy reforms. Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) emphasises 
the importance of behavioural changes and citizen participation in India's 
approach to climate action and sustainability, working alongside government-
led mitigation and adaptation efforts.
Although India’s per capita emissions remain well below the global average, 
climate change poses risks to livelihoods, infrastructure, and economic stability. 
Adaptation is, therefore, central to India’s climate strategy, driven primarily 
by public investment and community-based action. The chapter examines 
how State Action Plans on Climate Change integrate water security, resilient 
livelihoods, urban resilience, and ecosystem restoration into development 
objectives, ensuring that development gains are sustained.
India is also pursuing a balanced mitigation pathway, scaling renewables, 
battery storage, and nuclear energy in line with the objective of energy security 
and industrial competitiveness. However, inadequate global capital flows to 
developing countries remain a significant constraint, underscoring the need to 
reform multilateral financial institutions and to strengthen domestic financial 
systems. The chapter further reviews the evolution of environmental regulations 
and their role in enabling sustainable development. 
INTRODUCTION
10.1	 The global climate change agenda has reached an inflexion point. What was once 
framed as a straightforward moral and technological transition toward a net-zero future 
is today marked by complex trade-offs, capacity constraints and a widening gap between 
ambition and operational reality. Nowhere is this tension more visible than in parts 
of Europe, which have presented themselves as the vanguard of the energy transition 
but are now confronting the practical and institutional stresses that follow from rapid 
decarbonisation undertaken ahead of grid readiness, storage depth, and industrial

system resilience.1 These developments matter deeply for emerging economies such 
as India because they reveal the structural nature of transition risk, the importance 
of sequencing, and the consequences of allowing complexity to outpace institutional 
capacity.
10.2	Europe’s recent experience illustrates these pressures in a particularly striking 
way. In the Netherlands, celebrated as a leader in renewables and electric mobility, the 
rapid deployment of solar and wind energy has collided with a distribution network 
designed for an earlier era of centralised thermal generation.2 The result has been 
congestion, curtailment, and long waiting times for industrial connections, as well 
as appeals to households to moderate evening consumption to avoid overloading the 
system. The challenge here is not ideological, but infrastructural: renewable capacity 
has expanded faster than balancing systems, transmission reinforcement and storage 
technologies. The consequence is that intermittency-related costs — from maintaining 
thermal reserves to the capital burden of grid upgrades — are felt in both reliability 
stress and headline tariffs.
10.3	A similar story is visible elsewhere. On 28th April 2025, Spain3 experienced 
a widespread grid disruption triggered by a combination of network instability 
during a period of high renewable energy output and transmission system sensitivity 
under shifting load conditions. The result is that intermittency-related costs — from 
maintaining thermal reserves to the capital burden of grid reinforcement — increasingly 
surface not through higher tariffs but through episodes of reliability stress and tighter 
operating margins. This isn’t criticism of renewable energy itself; it’s a reminder that if 
we introduce complex systems too quickly without buffers, redundancy and institutional 
capacity, the system is likely to become fragile instead of thriving.
10.4	Taken together, these strands of evidence point to a common lesson: transitions 
are more durable when sequencing, system buffers and institutional depth are treated 
as intrinsic elements of design rather than assumed to follow. This is especially salient 
for emerging economies, where growth, energy security and resilience must advance 
alongside low-carbon pathways, and not be displaced by it.
10.5	Across several advanced economies, these stresses follow a common pattern: 
storage lags investment commitments, balancing costs rise, and transmission

bottlenecks multiply. The result is what may be described as an entropy effect, in which 
well-intentioned transition strategies inadvertently increase systemic volatility unless 
accompanied by buffers, redundancies and stabilising structures.
10.6	This pattern underscores a broader lesson. In the early years after the Paris 
Agreement, there was a disproportionate emphasis on renewable energy capacity 
additions, procurement targets, and signalling ambition, while underestimating the 
engineering and financial challenges of maintaining stability in grids dominated by 
intermittent generation. The real cost of renewable power at scale includes storage, 
reserve capacity, balancing operations and transmission reinforcement. When these 
remain implicit rather than explicit, the policy narrative tends to understate the degree 
of institutional preparation required for a reliable and just transition.
10.7	More recently, the broader global climate discourse has undergone a gradual shift 
toward greater realism. Policymakers and assessment institutions have become more 
attentive to the distinction between what climate science can state with high confidence 
and what remains subject to uncertainty, natural variability and modelling limitations. 
The evidence from official assessments indicates that while the planet has warmed 
and human activity exerts a measurable warming influence, the translation of these 
findings into deterministic or catastrophic policy narratives often compresses nuance 
and downplays uncertainty. A more careful reading suggests that climate risk — though 
serious — is best addressed through measured, evidence-based strategies that preserve 
energy security, competitiveness and social stability, rather than through alarmist 
framings that may weaken institutional credibility or crowd out legitimate policy trade-
offs.
10.8	A complementary body of empirical work4 points in a similar direction, 
underscoring the value of calibrated interpretation when translating climate evidence 
into policy and design. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s 2021 
release of local sea-level projections has been an important step for infrastructure and 
adaptation planning; however, a recent global comparison with tide-gauge observations 
suggests that only a small proportion of locations worldwide records of sufficient length 
and continuity for robust estimation. Across this subset, nearly 95 per cent of sites 
show no statistically significant acceleration in sea-level rise, and projected rates are, 
on average, about two millimetres per year higher than those observed, with the limited 
instances of acceleration largely associated with local, non-climatic factors, such as 
subsidence or land-use-driven ground movement.5 The implication is not to downplay

climate risk, but to highlight the need for context-specific assessment and institutional 
prudence in operationalising projections. 
10.9	This more balanced perspective aligns with the argument advanced in Bill Gates’ 
reflections ahead of the Conference of the Parties (COP)30.6 The central theme is that 
climate policy should prioritise human welfare, particularly for poorer and climate-
vulnerable societies. Climate change will have meaningful consequences, but it is unlikely 
to produce civilisational collapse; innovation, declining green-cost premia and targeted 
investments are more durable low-carbon pathways than rapidly imposed constraints 
that erode growth. Equally, scarce fiscal resources should not be diverted away from 
health, agriculture and poverty reduction merely to accelerate near-term mitigation 
milestones. Growth and prosperity strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability, and 
must therefore be treated as complementary to climate strategy rather than competing 
with it.
10.10	 Taken together, these perspectives reinforce an important ethical and strategic 
principle: development is, in itself, a form of adaptation. While emissions 
mitigation is also important, effective climate action encompasses much more; it also 
depends on improving societal capacity to withstand shocks through stronger health 
systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, enhanced agricultural productivity, and 
access to affordable and reliable energy. Measured in terms of human welfare rather 
than temperature outcomes alone, the most effective strategies are those that expand 
opportunity while reducing vulnerability, remaining transparent about uncertainties 
and pragmatic about the limits of what climate science can presently resolve with 
confidence. 
10.11	 For India, these developments carry important implications. Achieving sustained 
growth and rising living standards will require a substantial expansion in the supply 
of affordable and reliable electricity. Renewable energy will play a major and growing 
role in this expansion; however, capacity additions alone do not automatically translate 
into a dependable supply, particularly at non-solar peak times or during periods of 
high variability. As renewable penetration rises, the cost of maintaining dispatchable 
thermal capacity increases, even as utilisation declines, while grid stability challenges 
intensify. India must, therefore, approach the coming decade not as a climate policy 
problem in isolation, but as a broader energy system strategy — one that sequences the 
transition in line with growth, security, and institutional preparedness.
10.12	 Such a strategy must prioritise pragmatism over signalling: maintaining sufficient 
dispatchable power capacity to support industrialisation and social development even

as renewables scale; strengthening transmission and distribution; investing in storage 
and grid-management technologies; and restoring emphasis on hydro and nuclear as 
long-horizon anchors for low-carbon development. Internationally, India’s negotiating 
stance must remain grounded in first principles — predictable and front-loaded finance 
reflecting full-system costs, technology flows that support resilience rather than 
compliance, and commitments that respect differentiated capabilities, responsibilities 
and risk exposures.
10.13	 Advanced economies have been the first to discover that decarbonisation at scale 
is an engineering, financial and institutional undertaking with unavoidable trade-offs. 
Their experience does not diminish the urgency of climate action; rather, it clarifies 
the conditions under which it can be sustained. For India, the lesson is to articulate, 
calmly and firmly, a pathway that protects growth, builds resilience and preserves 
strategic flexibility, while remaining committed to responsible climate action on terms 
that are technologically feasible, developmentally coherent and compatible with India’s 
economic aspirations. 
10.14	 India has grown sustainably with per capita carbon emissions considerably lower 
than the global average.7 India's climate action strategy has developed around three main 
pillars. Firstly, adaptation needs to be at the forefront given the country's significant 
vulnerability to physical impacts of climate change, such as the loss of life and property 
and health concerns due to intensification of extreme weather events, concerns of water 
and food security, slow-onset events like rising sea-level, amongst others.8 Prioritising 
adaptation not only addresses immediate climate challenges but also provides local 
economic benefits by protecting livelihoods, safeguarding infrastructure investments, 
and minimising disaster-related losses. This approach is largely realised through public 
investments initiated by the central government, strategic planning at the state level, 
and community-driven programs woven into broader development efforts.
10.15	 Secondly, India is also taking mitigation action by phasing-in renewables, 
improving energy efficiency and diversifying energy sources to green hydrogen and 
nuclear power. The approach is to prioritise energy security, affordability and industrial 
competitiveness. However, this transition faces various intertwined challenges, 
including limited access to advanced technologies, vulnerabilities in supply chains for 
critical minerals essential for clean energy, and constrained availability of reliable and 
affordable financial capital.

10.16	 Thirdly, a predominant reliance on domestic resources as international climate 
finance and international financial regulation has both become binding constraints. 
While global capital is abundant, it does not flow at scale to developing countries 
due to structural features of the international financial system and risk perceptions, 
resulting in a high cost of capital. In recent years, India has made significant progress 
in enhancing its financial ecosystem through regulatory reforms. The country has 
streamlined its financial markets and introduced innovative instruments for sustainable 
finance, including frameworks for thematic bonds like green, blue, yellow, transition, 
social, sustainability to support sustainable development goals including interventions 
to address climate action projects. Sovereign green bonds have backed public sector 
initiatives focused on environmentally friendly projects, while a green deposit 
framework emphasises mobilising capital for sustainability. Additionally, specialised 
financial institutions are playing a vital role in aligning the financial sector with the 
nation's climate sustainability goals. 
10.17	 Internationally, there's a growing need to reform multilateral development 
finance,9 credit ratings,10 and the use of risk-sharing instruments.11 At the same time, 
environmental regulation in India is transitioning from procedural, command-and-
control approaches toward risk-based, technology-enabled, and outcome-oriented 
governance that supports both environmental protection and ease of doing business.
10.18	 Against this backdrop, this chapter examines India's national and subnational 
strategies across adaptation, mitigation, climate finance, and regulation; it underscores 
the importance of Mission-LiFE as a cross-cutting theme and draws lessons for policy 
design and economic planning. It highlights how climate action, when embedded in 
development priorities, can strengthen resilience, enhance competitiveness, and 
support India’s long-term growth trajectory.
10.19	 The rest of the chapter is organised as follows: The second section focuses on 
adaptation measures, highlighting the actions taken by the Government of India and 
various subnational initiatives that address a range of local needs. The third section 
discusses mitigation strategies, including India's renewable energy imperatives, access 
to critical minerals, the political economy of the transition, and the new Carbon Credit 
Trading Scheme. The fourth section addresses Mission LiFE and its implementation

across different sectors. The fifth section covers climate finance, detailing the steps India 
is taking to mobilise resources for climate action. Finally, the sixth section examines 
the evolution of environmental regulations and the measures being implemented to 
enhance its effectiveness. The chapter concludes with key lessons and recommendations 
for future action. 
Adaptation: Strengthening climate resilience 
10.20	 Given our country’s vulnerability to climate change, action is necessary to 
ensure continuing economic stability, secure and enhanced livelihoods, and to protect 
infrastructure from risks such as droughts, floods, and rising sea levels. Integrating 
climate adaptation and resilience into development plans is essential for sustainable 
growth.12 Unlike mitigation, adaptation offers immediate benefits by reducing losses, 
stabilising incomes, locking in development and safeguarding investments, helping us 
build a more resilient future.
10.21	 Despite the urgency for adaptation, international and private capital flows 
remain constrained and disproportionately skewed towards mitigation efforts. The 
2025 Adaptation Gap Report estimates that developing countries will require between 
USD 310 billion and USD 365 billion annually by 2035, whereas the current flow of 
international public adaptation finance to developing countries is approximately 
USD 26 billion.13 The Economic Survey for 2024–25 emphasised the importance of 
integrating climate adaptation into our policy-making process. This Chapter provides 
further details on this subject with specific reference to the sub-national measures, 
acknowledging that the challenges posed by climate change and the ways to tackle them 
are often unique to specific locations and communities. 
Public Investment–Led Climate Adaptation in India
10.22	 India’s climate adaptation strategy is predominantly advanced through a 
development-led approach, utilising domestic public investment in core development 
sectors. Adequate and sustained financing is the backbone of effective adaptation and 
resilience-building in India. Scaling up existing adaptation actions and addressing 
the substantial financing gap requires diversified resource mobilisation. Reflecting a 
strategic pivot towards self-funded resilience, India mainstreams adaptation through 
national and state-level planning backed by domestic resources. India’s adaptation 
and resilience-related domestic spending surged from 3.7 per cent of the GDP in FY16

to 5.6 per cent of the GDP in FY22.14 The National Action Plan on Climate Change 
(NAPCC)15 spearheads climate action through nine missions – on solar energy, energy 
efficiency, sustainable habitats, water management, the Himalayan ecosystem, green 
India, sustainable agriculture, and strategic knowledge for climate change and health - 
implemented by the respective nodal ministry/department.  Many of these are focused 
on adaptation.  
10.23	 The National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture16 promotes climate-
resilient farming through initiatives such as "Per Drop More Crop," which focuses 
on efficient water use, Rainfed Area Development for integrated farming, and 
Soil Health Management supported by the Soil Health Card scheme. In the area of 
water management, the National Water Mission emphasises conservation and fair 
access through integrated resource management. It supports State-Specific Plans 
and rainwater harvesting initiatives, providing financial help to States and Union 
Territories. The National Programme on Climate Change and Human Health raises 
awareness about health impacts from climate change and aims to strengthen health 
systems, particularly for vulnerable groups. The National Mission on Sustainable 
Habitat integrates adaptation into urban development through programs such as the 
Swachh Bharat Mission and urban transport initiatives, thereby enhancing climate 
resilience and liveability.
10.24	 India has adopted an integrated approach to coastal and marine resilience, 
linking ecosystem protection with livelihood security and climate adaptation. The 
National Coastal Mission strengthens integrated coastal zone management and 
climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby directly reducing the vulnerability of coastal 
communities to sea-level rise and extreme weather events. Complementing this, the 
Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats & Tangible Incomes (MISHTI) envisages 
the restoration and reforestation of mangroves over approximately 540 square 
kilometres across nine coastal States and four Union Territories over a five-year period 
(2023–2028). The programme is implemented through convergence with existing 
schemes and programmes, enabling states to integrate mangrove restoration within 
ongoing development efforts. MISHTI is expected to generate around 22.8 million 
person-days of employment, create an estimated carbon sink of 4.5 million tonnes, and 
unlock opportunities for nature-based tourism and sustainable livelihoods for coastal 
communities.17 In parallel, the National Plan for Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems

has expanded protected wetlands that support flood moderation and water security—
critical buffers under climate stress. Together with Mission LiFE, which promotes 
behavioural adaptation and mindful resource use, these initiatives reflect a shift toward 
ecosystem-led, development-integrated climate resilience.
10.25	 In India’s federal framework, climate adaptation is advanced through coordinated 
action across national, state, and local levels. National frameworks and programmes 
provide policy coherence, financial support, and institutional mechanisms, while States 
contextualise and operationalise these interventions through sectoral policies, public 
programmes, and local institutions. These have played a critical role in enhancing 
development and environmental conservation activities that promote ecological 
restoration and strengthen rural-urban infrastructure. The Viksit Bharat – Guarantee 
for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) (VB-G RAM G) Act, 2025, aims to strengthen 
the interventions. Details are covered in Chapter XIII Rural Development.
Box X.1: Kerala Climate Resilient Agri-Value Chain Modernisation  
Project (KERA)18 
The Government of Kerala, with support from the World Bank, is implementing the Kerala 
Climate-Resilient Agri-Value Chain Modernisation (KERA) Project to build a climate-
resilient, competitive, and market-oriented agricultural sector. With an outlay of USD 285 
million (₹2,365 crore), the project aims to enhance climate resilience, boost productivity, 
promote value addition, and strengthen market linkages across priority agri-value chains, 
directly benefiting over 400,000 farmers statewide.
KERA is structured around three core components. First, it promotes climate-resilient 
and low-carbon cultivation processes as a co-benefit of mitigation. Second, it supports 
smallholder commercialisation by facilitating up to 150 Productive Alliances between 
Farmer-Producer Companies (FPCs) and agribusinesses, with grants of up to ₹2 crore per 
alliance, alongside support for replantation of certified climate-resilient varieties of coffee, 
cardamom, and rubber. Third, the project strengthens agri-food MSMEs and agri-tech start-
ups through grants to about 200 MSMEs (up to ₹1.5 crore each), support to 150 agri-tech 
start-ups, and the development of agri-parks and food parks to enable cluster-based growth.
Implemented across all 14 districts of Kerala, KERA focuses on measurable outcomes—
higher farm incomes, enterprise growth, job creation, and improved resilience to climate 
shocks—while ensuring inclusive participation of small and marginal farmers, women-led 
enterprises, FPCs, and rural entrepreneurs.
10.26	 Further, states play a crucial role in planning and implementing adaptation 
strategies to address climate change. The State Action Plans on Climate Change 
(SAPCCs) are crucial tools for translating NAPCC's broader objectives into actionable 
steps. These plans are tailored to the specific needs of different regions, whether they are

vulnerable coastal areas or unique Himalayan ecosystems. Initially, the SAPCCs placed a 
strong emphasis on mitigation efforts to reduce emissions. Recent revisions of SAPCCs19 
reflect a gradual shift towards adaptation-led development, with increasing emphasis 
on contextual risk considerations, sectoral vulnerabilities, and alignment with district-
level development priorities, where available. Overall, it is about making our responses to 
climate change more robust and better aligned with the unique challenges faced by each 
region.

through sustainable forest management. The initiative focuses on watershed treatment, 
forest restoration, and participatory community involvement, with plans to establish 
plantations over 8,430 hectares and to treat and protect two key catchments—Umiew 
and Ganol. Advanced Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping has been utilised 
to capture more than 55,000 springs, to enable timely corrective actions. Over 500 
community-based water-harvesting projects are also being established to improve climate-
resilient water management for communities in the state. These initiatives not only 
aim to secure water resources but also empower communities to adapt to the changing 
climate effectively. Collectively, these measures strengthen water security while enhancing 
community resilience to climate change in the state.

Agriculture enhanced 538 minor irrigation systems across 15 districts, benefiting around 
125,000 households. By integrating modern irrigation techniques with sustainable 
agriculture and aquaculture practices, the project has achieved a 28.8 per cent increase in 
water productivity, a 67.8 per cent rise in agricultural output, a 105 per cent growth in high-
value vegetable farming, and a 27 per cent boost in household incomes. These initiatives are

The scheme charges an affordable annual premium of ₹354, and subscribers receive 
payouts ranging from ₹750 to ₹1,250.25 By directly linking compensation to objectively 
measured weather conditions, the scheme provides a timely and predictable safety 
net for workers and recognises heat stress as an economic shock, rather than merely a 
public health concern.
10.32	 Uttarakhand - A community radio station is leading disaster 
preparedness: Mandakini ki Aawaz, a community-run radio station in Sena Gadsari 
village, Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand, makes critical information and early warnings 
accessible to the community. By regularly corresponding with the India Meteorological 
Department, Dehradun, and the Uttarakhand State Disaster Management Authority, 
the radio station delivers early warnings, public service announcements, and disaster 
advisories that enhance preparedness before an extreme event, facilitate coordination 
during emergencies, and support recovery efforts.26
10.33	 Jodhpur - Community cooling stations are a model of community 
resilience: Jodhpur Nagar Nigam North and Mahila Housing Trust , supported by the 
Natural Resources Defence Council, recently launched a net-zero cooling station as part 
of the city’s Heat Action Plan27 in key heat-vulnerable localities in the city. The stations 
combine passive cooling (wind towers, vetiver curtains, misting fans) with solar power 
and reflective roofing. They provide drinking water and first aid, offering refuge for 
outdoor workers and daily wage earners, who have limited access to air-conditioned 
spaces. By integrating passive cooling techniques, renewable energy, and traditional 
architectural elements, the facility serves as a model for scalable urban community 
cooling infrastructure. Early evidence suggests that the conditions inside the cooling 
centre are substantially cooler than those outdoors. In late April 2024, the temperature 
inside was about 8°C cooler during the hottest hours, from 12 PM to 6 PM.28

or coastlines alone; they must be built into the economic and business frameworks 
that sustain livelihoods and cities. Services such as decentralised renewable energy, 
solid waste management, and safe drinking water are emerging as resilience assets, 
strengthening local adaptive capacity while also advancing India’s mitigation goals. 
The Climate Resilient Villages initiatives, such as those in Karnataka,29 Tamil Nadu,30 
and Odisha31 demonstrate how resilience can be institutionalised at the grassroots by 
transforming resilience from a project into a local governance function. As Indian cities 
continue to grow at a rapid pace, internalising climate risk into the fabric of urban 
planning, means considering how climate change affects land use, infrastructure, and 
the services provided to residents. By acknowledging these challenges, such as rising 
temperatures, flooding, and water shortages, we can better prepare our urban areas to 
address them. Building resilience is also vital for ensuring that the urban centres can 
thrive and continue driving economic growth.
Mitigation: Transition to a low-carbon economy
10.35	 India is adopting a multifaceted approach to mitigate global warming by 
diversifying its energy sources and enhancing access while also increasing the share 
of non-fossil fuels, improving energy efficiency, and promoting stability across its 
energy systems. These strategies align with the nation's development and sustainability 
objectives. A comprehensive range of policies has been implemented to achieve the 
2030 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets.
10.36	 The Economic Survey 2024–25 noted the potential of a rapid expansion of 
variable renewable energy sources without adequate firm baseload capacity and grid 
reinforcement leading to higher electricity prices, thereby compromising energy 
security. Experiences in the United Kingdom highlight how declining firm power source 
has contributed to higher system costs. Another case is Germany, which is experiencing 
rising household and industrial energy prices as a result of its energy transition policies.32 
As mentioned earlier, Spain and the Netherlands have recently faced growing grid 
instability and capacity limitations, reflecting the risks associated with transitions that 
outpace investments in baseload generation, transmission, and system flexibility. In 
the Netherlands, grid congestion has become severe enough to prompt public appeals 
to reduce electricity use during peak hours, while nearly 14,000 firms remain on waiting

Energy Transformation at Scale: India's Renewable Imperative
10.37	 India’s energy transition is being pursued through a combination of initiatives 
across various sectors, including nuclear, solar, and wind energy, green hydrogen, 
battery storage, and critical minerals, which help address both energy security and 
transition imperatives simultaneously. Details of some of these initiatives are presented 
in this section.
Recent measures to boost non-fossil fuel sources of energy
10.38	 The country has already surpassed the goal of 50 per cent installed power capacity 
from non-fossil fuel sources (stood at 51.93 per cent at the end of December 202535), 
supported by record annual additions of renewable energy capacity (Chart X.2). During 
2025-26 (up to 31st December 2025), a total of 38.61 GW of renewable energy capacity 
has been installed in the country, which includes 30.16 GW of solar power, 4.47 GW of 
wind power, 0.03 GW of Bio-Power and 3.24 GW of hydro power.36 
10.39	 According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)’s Renewable 
Energy Statistics 2025,37 India now ranks fourth globally in total installed renewable 
energy capacity (after China, the USA, and Brazil), which underscores India’s growing 
influence in global clean energy markets.

Box X.2: The Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for 
Transforming India (SHANTI) Act, 2025
Nuclear is one of the cleanest forms of energy, capable of overcoming the concerns of 
intermittency and energy security associated with other renewable sources of energy 
like solar and wind power. Besides, nuclear energy can provide a reliable energy source 
for heavy industries that find it difficult to use renewable sources due to technological 
challenges. It can be used to produce hydrogen to power vehicles, and industrial process.39 
The Government of India had announced the Nuclear Energy Mission in the Union Budget 
2025-26 and allocated ₹20,000 crore with the aim of developing at least five indigenously 
designed and operational small modular reactors (SMRs) by 2033.40  
India currently has a total nuclear capacity of 8,780 megawatt (MW).41 The Central Electricity 
Authority has also estimated that the capacity mix of the power system in 2047 would have 
100 GW of nuclear power capacity.42 
Therefore, as a major step forward in this direction, India has adopted the landmark 
Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India 
(SHANTI) Act in December 2025. The SHANTI Act consolidates and modifies India’s nuclear 
legal framework43- the Atomic Energy Act, 1962, and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage 
Act, (CLNDA) 2010 to enable participation of the private sector or state governments, 
previously not allowed under the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and also addresses liability 
structure under the CLNDA44 by establishing a graded liability framework, but without 
diluting victim compensation.45 The new framework enables private sector participation in 
key activities, including plant operations, power generation, equipment manufacturing and 
carrying out research and innovations in the field of peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
10.41	 Despite the progress in expanding non-fossil fuel energy, challenges remain. 
The renewable energy systems of solar and wind are highly material-intensive and 
require capital-intensive energy storage technologies for integrating renewable energy

into the energy grid. Material and storage requirements represent the two roadblocks 
to greater utilisation of these energy sources. The former extends beyond the access 
to critical minerals and is likely to have implications for the requirements of mining 
and energy for material processing (Box X.4). With respect to energy technology, the 
challenge is not just the need for new technologies, but also the substantial investment 
requirements. The unit cost of storage capacity installed is determined by the number 
of times each MW of storage is used in a year, which is likely to be less for short-term 
storage capacities than long-term capacities.46 The following subsections delve into 
these two challenges. 
The Case for Battery Storage
10.42	 The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimated that India will require around 
336 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of energy storage capacity by 2029–30 and 411 GWh by 
2031–32 to support the reliable integration of renewable energy sources.47 To enable 
this scale-up, a coordinated set of policy, regulatory, demand-side, and supply-side 
measures is being implemented. 
10.43	 Energy storage systems are formally recognised under the Electricity Rules as an 
integral part of the power system48 and are included in the Harmonised Master List of 
Infrastructure49 improving access to long-tenure, lower-cost finance. Storage has been 
embedded in the Resource Adequacy Planning Guidelines50 and supported through a 
National Framework for the Promotion of Energy Storage Systems.51 
10.44	 Market and regulatory measures have been introduced to expand revenue streams 
for storage, including the waiver of inter-state transmission charges for co-located 
battery storage energy system (BESS) and pumped storage projects until June 2028,52

Market,54 and tariff-based competitive bidding guidelines for BESS procurement.55 To 
accelerate deployment, the Government has launched two Viability Gap Funding (VGF) 
schemes supporting approximately 43 GWh of BESS (March 2024 and June 2025).56 
Further, manufacturing is supported through a ₹18,100 crore Production-Linked 
Incentive (PLI) scheme for 50 GWh of Advanced Chemistry Cell capacity, in which 
10 GWh is earmarked for grid-scale storage.57 For pumped storage projects, a grant-
based support is provided to enable infrastructure.58 Regulatory clearances have been 
streamlined for closed-loop projects, and ownership of storage has been liberalised to 
include consumers. Additional measures include advisory norms for co-locating storage 
of at least 10 per cent of installed solar capacity59 to improve the dispatchability of solar 
power.
10.45	 Recently, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)60 committed USD 
51.4 million (₹460 crore) in FY26 to IndiGrid Infrastructure Trust, an AAA-rated 
transmission infrastructure investment trust regulated by SEBI, to support the 
deployment of a 180MW/360Mwh utility-scale standalone BESS in Gujarat. The 
project is the largest standalone BESS in India, setting a scale and technology standard 
for future deployments. To de-risk this first-of-a-kind project and effectively reduce 
upfront costs, the commitment was strategically structured to include concessional 
support from the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), a multi-donor trust fund.
Box X.3: Renewable energy integration in the State of Kerala
Given the intermittent nature of solar energy, an effective way to utilise it would be to consume 
the electricity generated during the day and store the excess or export it to the grid. Batteries are 
still expensive; therefore, exporting to the grid remains a practical option, where a distribution 
company (discom) or power utility serves as the backup. To enable effective integration with 
the grid the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB)61 now requires new connected households,

as well as industrial and agricultural solar plants, to install battery storage capacities. For 
example, Rooftop solar systems above 10 kilowatt(kW)  would need to have 10 per cent battery 
storage, and those between 15 and 20 kW would require 20 per cent. After 2027, even smaller 
5 kW systems would require storage. Battery capacities in solar plants are expected to address 
the issue of intermittency of solar power. Another incentive to increase the uptake of battery 
storage alongside solar power is also being provided through a gross metering mechanism, 
which offers higher tariffs to customers who have battery storage.
Critical Minerals and the Political Economy of the Energy Transition-
Balancing Resilience, Standards, and Inclusiveness
10.46	 The global energy transition is no longer solely determined by technology; it is 
increasingly constrained by who controls critical minerals. Metals like Lithium, cobalt, 
nickel, copper, and rare earth elements have become the new strategic chokepoints in 
shaping the contours of a low-carbon economy, influencing   energy security, industrial 
competitiveness, and geopolitical power, as observed through several trade restrictions 
on export of critical minerals by source countries.62 Copper, in particular, is becoming 
a highly price-volatile metal63 due to a number of factors. These include a series of 
mine outages64 in Indonesia, Congo, and Chile65 rising concerns of a supply deficit in 
medium to long terms, given perpetually growing demand from the power sector and 
data centres across the world, and trade protectionist measures.66
Box X.4: Material requirements for Renewable Energy 
The numbers below give a sense of the amount of investment that India may be required to 
make in renewable energy generation and the tremendous amount of energy they need in 
the first place:
Solar panels with a power capacity of 1 GW require approximately 18.5 tons of silver, 2,000-
3,000 tons of polysilicon, and 10,252 tons of aluminium. To make the 1 GW, 18.5 tons of 
silver: 18.5 × 250 MWh = 4,625 MWh is roughly the equivalent of the yearly electricity 
consumption of 350-400 US households. Producing the aluminium requires 10,252 tons 
× 190 gigajoules per ton (GJ/ton) = ~1,948,000 GJ, equivalent to the yearly electricity 
consumption of over 100,000 average households.

The world will also soon run short of copper at the current rate of rising power demand, in 
part due to the proliferation of AI data centres. A single example illustrates the investment 
and operational costs involved. It would take 1,194 truckloads to provide the 2,866 tons of 
copper needed for a 1 GW wind turbine—that’s just for the copper. 
To produce 2,866 tons of copper from ore with a 0.6 per cent yield, miners must process 
about 167–200 tons of ore per ton of copper. Current estimates (2020s) place the average 
for operating mines at approximately 0.5–0.6 per cent  with many large mines below 0.6 per 
cent and new projects even lower (around 0.4–0.5 per cent ). The formula is: Total material 
required (tons) = Copper produced (tons) ÷ Yield (decimal). Total material = 2,866 ÷ 0.006 
= 477,666.67 tons. Divided by 400-ton trucks, this equals 1,194 truckloads.
This already assumes only the copper-bearing ore, no waste rock, no overburden,67 no 
rejected material, no processing losses. In real mines, the total material moved is typically 
2–4 times higher once waste rock stripping is factored in. If fully accounted for, total material 
moved per GW of wind power would likely exceed 1–2 million tons, not 0.48 million.

10.47	 As demand accelerates, advanced economies are responding by promoting 
standards-based critical mineral markets, emphasising sustainability, traceability, and 
governance. Initiatives such as the G7 Roadmap to Promote Standards-Based Markets 
for Critical Minerals68 aim to enhance transparency, reduce concentration risks, and 
encourage responsible sourcing. However, implementing digital traceability systems, 
meeting certification requirements, and enhancing environment, social and governance 
(ESG) compliance can entail substantial costs. While these objectives are legitimate, 
standards are not neutral technical tools. They are instruments of market power. Their 
design will determine who can enter supply chains, who captures value, and who bears 
transition costs.
10.48	 From the perspective of developing countries, the current direction presents 
three significant challenges. Firstly, there's a risk that standards could turn into barriers 
instead of facilitating progress. With the introduction of digital traceability systems, 
certification requirements, and ESG compliance, the upfront costs and ongoing expenses 
can be quite steep. For many resource-rich developing nations, these financial burdens 
may lead to investor pessimism, and slow down project development, and limit supply. 
This is especially concerning as the world urgently needs these countries to ramp up 
their efforts in response to global transitions.
10.49	 Second, there is a real concern that standards wherein if narrowly defined or 
asymmetrically enforced, can trap developing countries in the lowest-value segments

of supply chains, exporting raw materials while concentrating value-added processing 
and manufacturing in advanced economies. 
10.50	 Third, affordability is adversely impacted. Sustainability premiums that tend 
to raise mineral prices without parallel support for finance, technology, and capacity-
building will increase costs to transitioning globally and disproportionately impact 
emerging economies. A transition that is clean but unaffordable is neither rapid nor 
just. A durable global framework for critical minerals must therefore move beyond 
compliance-centric thinking. It must be inclusive, capacity-sensitive, and development-
oriented. Resource-rich regions in Africa, Latin America, and Asia must be treated 
as co-producers of value, rather than merely sources of raw materials. This requires 
careful deliberation on aspects of international cooperation on technology transfer, 
skills, institutions, and investment in mining, processing, and recycling. 
10.51	 India’s strategy reflects this balance with a focus on domestic capabilities through 
the National Critical Mineral Mission along with suitable incentive mechanism, while 
engaging in international partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership69  and the 
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.70  India consistently demonstrates that there is a 
complementarity between strategic autonomy and global integration.
10.52	 The Government of India has launched the National Critical Mineral Mission 
(NCMM)71 as a strategic initiative to secure the supply chain of minerals essential for 
renewable energy and storage technologies. The major objectives of the Mission are to 
secure domestic and foreign sourcing of critical minerals and strengthen value chains. 
10.53	 Amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 
202372  have broadened the central government authority to auction 24 of 30 identified 
critical minerals and opened exploration and mining of six previously restricted 
minerals to private sector participation. Further, the MMDR Act was amended with 
effect from 01.09.2025. Through the said amendment, provision has been made in the 
Act for inclusion of any new mineral in a mining lease. This will boost mining of critical 
minerals in the country.

approved the setting up of the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) on 29 January 
2025 with a financial outlay of ₹16,300 crore and expected investment of 18,000 crore 
from PSUs and others. The Mission aims to secure a long-term sustainable supply of 
critical minerals and strengthen India’s critical mineral value chains encompassing all 
stages from mineral exploration and mining to beneficiation, processing, and recovery 
from end-of-life products.
10.56	 To build supply chain resilience in critical minerals, the Union Cabinet has 
approved a ₹1,500 crore Incentive Scheme for Promotion of Critical Mineral Recycling 
under NCMM. The scheme will incentivise that part of the recycling value chain in which 
actual extraction of critical minerals takes place, and will develop recycling capacity for 
critical materials in the country for the separation and production of critical minerals 
from secondary sources.  
Carbon Credit Trading Scheme: from framework to implementation
10.57	 India has made substantial progress in establishing its carbon market framework, 
a crucial step towards developing its mitigation strategy. The government adopted 
the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) in June 2023, operating through a dual 
mechanism that incorporates mandatory compliance and voluntary offset approaches.74 
The compliance mechanism targets energy-intensive industrial sectors through an 
emission intensity-based baseline-and-credit system, initially covering sectors such as 
cement, iron and steel etc.75 Entities that exceed their emissions intensity targets earn 
Carbon Credit Certificates (CCCs), denominated in tonnes of CO₂ equivalent(tCO2e), 
which they can trade on power exchanges. Those that fall short must buy and surrender 
equivalent credits. This framework leverages the existing Perform, Achieve and 
Trade (PAT) scheme infrastructure, gradually transitioning it into a fully operational 
compliance carbon market. In 2025, the government notified pro-rata Greenhouse Gas 
Emission Intensity (GEI) targets for four sectors: Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, 
and Pulp and Paper.
10.58	 Under the Offset Mechanism, Non-Obligated Entities may voluntarily register 
projects that reduce, remove, or avoid greenhouse gas emissions to earn CCCs. This

Box X.5: Developments in the International Carbon Markets
Several major economies have operationalised emissions trading systems (ETS) as market-
based instruments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, offering useful lessons for countries 
designing or scaling domestic carbon markets. The European Union Emissions Trading 
System, the Korea Emissions Trading Scheme, and the China National ETS represent three 
of the world’s major emissions trading systems, reflecting different design choices and 
stages of market maturity. 
The EU ETS, launched in 2005, is a cap-and-trade, compliance-based system with an absolute 
emissions cap that is progressively tightened over time. Evidence suggests that in the initial 
stages of the EU ETS, oversupply of offset credits led to dilution of emission prices. The 
ETS, now in its fourth phase, is highly complex, encompassing power, industry, domestic 
aviation, and maritime sectors in its current form. In general, the allowances accounting for 
up to 57 per cent of the emission cap are to be auctioned, and the rest are allocated freely to 
avoid “carbon leakage”76  in susceptible sectors, such as steel, cement, aluminium, fertilisers, 
hydrogen, and iron and steel. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will 
gradually replace free allocation in such sectors from 2026 onwards. 
The EU has further introduced a new emissions trading system (ETS2) to cover CO2 
emissions from fuel combustion in buildings, road transport, and additional sectors (mainly

less ambitious climate policies, leading to an increase in overall greenhouse gas emissions.’ in European Union

small industries not covered by the existing EU ETS) (to be implemented by 2027).77 The use 
of offset credits, initially allowed, has now been discontinued in Phase Four. 
Korea’s ETS,78 operational since 2015, follows a similar cap-and-trade approach but places 
greater emphasis on calibrated free allocation and limits the use of offsets to manage 
competitiveness concerns. Korean ETS covers the maritime, waste, domestic aviation, 
transport, buildings, industry, and power sectors, with free allocations of allowances based 
on a benchmark system, which allows entities to use offsets up to 5 per cent of their verified 
emissions. 
China’s national ETS,79  implemented in 2017, covers the power, steel, cement, and aluminium 
smelter sectors, with annual emissions exceeding 26,000 tCO2, and is an intensity-based 
system. The allowances in the Chinese ETS are 100 per cent freely allocated using an output-
based (or-benchmark)80 approach, while also allowing entities to use offsets up to five per 
cent of their verified emissions.
A few lessons from these experiences in the context of the carbon markets framework are (a) 
a gradual approach to inclusion of sectors, (b) avoiding generous free allowances or allowing 
offsets to meet the targets and (c) ensuring alignment with country contexts.
Mission LiFE
10.59	 The Mission LiFE - Lifestyle for Environment, an initiative introduced in 2021, at 
COP26 in Glasgow, connects individual and community behaviour change with efforts 
to deal with climate change. In fact, LiFE is an integral part of India’s NDC. 
10.60	 By driving core shifts in consumption and production patterns towards 
sustainability, embedding circularity, and enabling adaptation to the impacts of climate 
change, the Mission's functions highlight that small, collective actions can cumulatively 
advance the country's climate goals. 
10.61	 Majority of India’s climate-oriented schemes are fundamentally aligned 
with the ethos of Mission LiFE, as they combine government interventions with 
behavioural and lifestyle shifts at the household, community and enterprise levels. In

mechanisms (PAT) encourage the use of less energy for the same service, embedding 
mindful consumption rather than only supply-side control on emissions. The NAPCC 
provides the overarching framework for India’s climate response, with its missions 
on energy efficiency, sustainable habitats, water, and agriculture explicitly promoting 
conservation, resource efficiency, and community participation, which are also the core 
principles of Mission LiFE. 
10.62	 Together, these examples demonstrate that India’s climate strategy is not confined 
to emissions targets or technologies alone, but is deliberately designed to reshape 
consumption patterns, social norms and daily choices, making Mission LiFE not a parallel 
initiative but the behavioural foundation underlying most climate policies in the country.
Box X.6: Transforming Waste into Wealth by Odisha81 
Odisha launched a state-wide mission to tackle solid waste in 2023, called the “Garbage-
Free Urban Odisha”. The mission combines advanced bio-mining technologies, strong 
institutional planning, and community participation through self-help groups to tackle 
legacy waste and transform reclaimed dumpsites into new wealth centres, thereby securing 
against further dumping. The Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has rolled out initiatives 
such as a coconut waste processing facility, a flower waste facility, a 150-tonnes per day 
(TPD) mega material recovery facility, and a 10-TPD plasma processor to convert waste 
into value-added products, creating livelihoods, and fostering innovation in urban waste 
management.
Climate Finance
10.63	 The current levels of climate finance fall short of the requirements of developing 
countries to meet their climate ambitions. By 2030, developing economies are estimated 
to need USD 5–6 trillion82 for climate action. The Fourth International Conference on 
Financing for Development, titled Compromiso de Sevilla83 recognised that, despite 
sustained global efforts, the gap between sustainable development ambitions and 
available financing has continued to widen—particularly for developing countries—
reaching an estimated USD 4 trillion annually. This gap does not arise from a lack of 
global capital, but rather from the disparity between where capital is concentrated and 
where investment needs for sustainable development are most pressing.

10.64	 Global financial assets under management reached USD 147 trillion in 2025,84 
yet climate finance flows remain highly skewed. In 2023, global climate finance totalled 
USD 1.9 trillion, of which private capital accounted for nearly USD 1.3 trillion. More 
than half of this private finance flowed to advanced economies, with China attracting 
another 30 per cent, while developing countries, excluding China, received only about 
15 per cent.85 International public finance to developing economies remains limited, 
and domestic actors continue to dominate global climate finance, accounting for nearly 
80 per cent of total flows.
10.65	 These patterns embedded in the international financial architecture reflect a 
persistent and clear bias in favour of developed countries. Capital tends to flow to the 
economies with deeper financial markets, stable macroeconomic conditions, and those 
that are generally perceived as having lower risks. Developing countries, however, 
face higher borrowing costs because of currency volatility, lower sovereign credit 
ratings, and financial systems that lack depth. As a result, despite the abundant global 
capital, investors often hesitate to finance climate resilience projects in developing 
countries, even when these nations are more vulnerable to climate change impacts 
and such investments could yield significant benefits. Investors, do not internalise the 
social benefit of their investments in developing countries [Box III.3: Microfinance, 
financialisation, and the need to re-centre household welfare in impact investing]. 
This imbalance not only hampers growth and development in these countries but also 
undermines global efforts to address the escalating climate crisis.
10.66	 India faces global challenges in climate finance. Although the country has 
successfully reduced its emissions intensity by 36 per cent since 2005 and achieved 50 
per cent non-fossil power capacity ahead of schedule,86 climate finance remains skewed 
towards mature sectors such as solar, wind energy and energy efficiency. Critical areas, 
including adaptation, financing for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), 
urban infrastructure, and hard-to-abate industries, remain underfunded. Currently, 
around 83 per cent of India’s finance for mitigation and 98 per cent of finance for 
adaptation is sourced domestically.87 However, the gaps in available finance and the 
needs persist,88 relying solely on domestic resources will not be sufficient.

The cost of capital for climate projects remains high, access to multilateral finance is

limited. Risk-mitigation and risk-sharing mechanisms are still underdeveloped, 
particularly for emerging technologies and large-scale adaptation projects.

substantial upfront capital and extended repayment horizons. Deeper, more liquid 
bond markets can provide long-term, stable, and scalable financing at predictable 
costs. On one hand, mature markets are important for attracting investments from 
institutional investors, which have long-term capital at their disposal.  On the other 
hand, bond markets provide an important platform for local administrative bodies to

only when sovereign green bonds are issued in large, liquid benchmark sizes, allow clear 
comparability with conventional bonds, provide credible and timely allocation and impact 
reporting, and are embedded within a stable sovereign debt programme. 
From the foregoing, it could be assessed that, in India, the modest and episodic greenium 
observed so far does not necessarily reflect a lack of investor interest. Deepening secondary

market liquidity, consolidating issuances into benchmark sizes, and strengthening post-
issuance reporting can help translate into a more significant cost-of-capital advantage over 
time.
10.73	 Strengthening National development finance institutions – Specialised 
financial institutions such as IREDA, NABARD, SIDBI, PFC, and REC are already 
working in the low-carbon/renewable energy space, promoting the adoption of 
sustainability practices and encouraging green investments through key initiatives 
and schemes. These institutions support climate project preparation and augment the 
bankability of projects through catalytic capital, which closely intersect with India’s 
development priorities including climate action. Further strengthening of the financial 
ecosystem through the mobilisation of blended finance, de-risking of projects, and 
capacity building through technical assistance and training are vital for enhancing the 
flow of resources for climate action. 
10.74	 Availability of insurance cover against climate risks – Expanding 
insurance coverage is essential to safeguard people against economic losses associated 
with the physical risks of climate change, but it also improves the creditworthiness of 
climate-exposed borrowers such as farmers and MSMEs. In India, the role of insurance 
is particularly significant for the agriculture sector, and is discussed in greater detail in 
Chapter VI Agriculture and Food Management.
International Climate Finance and the Role of Multilateral 
Development Banks
10.75	 International climate finance is critical for the global response to climate change. 
Article 9, subparagraph 1 of the Paris Agreement clearly mandates developed countries 
to provide financial resources to developing countries for their climate action, in 
line with equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and 
respective capabilities, in light of national circumstances. With respect to international 
commitments on climate finance – the USD 100 billion annual goal till 2025, while 
developed countries reported providing USD 115.9 billion in climate finance to 
developing countries in 2022,101 these figures are widely contested, with contrasting 
estimates suggesting that actual provision may be only USD 28–35 billion.102 With the 
continuing lack of clarity on climate finance provision under the Paris Agreement, COP 
30 in November 2025, in Belem, Brazil, arrived at an important decision on Article

9.1 of the Paris Agreement, establishing a two-year work programme under the COP.103 
This outcome helps shift the focus back to obligations rather than private investments 
being counted as climate finance.
10.76	 The disparity between climate vulnerability and financial capacity among 
nations needs to be acknowledged and addressed to ensure an effective global response 
to climate change, which is currently limited by both the insufficient volume of finance 
and high capital costs for developing countries. These costs are shaped by factors such 
as credit ratings, risk perceptions, and the structure of the global financial system.
Box X.8: Sustainable and Climate Finance — Plenty of Capital, Limited Risk 
Appetite104 
Despite sustained global efforts, financing for climate action remains far below requirements, 
particularly in developing countries. The impacts are evident in persistent energy poverty 
and rising climate vulnerability. The core challenge is not a shortage of global capital, but a 
structural misalignment between abundant liquidity and risk appetite. 
Global capital markets are flush with funds, yet flows to sustainable development and climate 
projects in the Global South remain constrained by entrenched risk aversion embedded in 
the architecture of global finance. This is most evident in the operating models of Multilateral 
Development Banks (MDBs) and in the prudential regulations of developed countries. 
MDBs continue to prioritise low-risk, sovereign-backed lending and the preservation of AAA 
ratings, limiting balance-sheet recycling and private capital mobilisation. A shift toward 
balance-sheet optimisation—from “originate-to-hold” to “originate-to-share”—is essential 
to reposition MDBs as global risk managers, utilising guarantees, insurance, and blended 
finance to attract private investment.
These constraints are reinforced by regulatory frameworks such as Basel III and Solvency II, 
which impose high capital charges on long-term, MDB-backed infrastructure investments in 
emerging economies, effectively excluding large pools of private capital. Further, an asset-
class mismatch persists: institutional investors prefer standardised, liquid securities, while 
developing-country projects are bespoke and fragmented. 
Unlocking scale requires MDB recapitalisation, strategic use of public capital as first-loss 
finance, regulatory recalibration, and strong governance safeguards. Reforms across MDB 
mandates, global regulations, and domestic financial systems are critical to align climate 
action with development priorities and deliver inclusive, resilient growth.

Recent innovations demonstrate how targeted risk-sharing can unlock private capital for 
climate action. In 2025, the Inter-American Development Bank and the Central Bank of 
Brazil105 established a mechanism to unlock up to USD 3.4 billion in long-term foreign-
exchange hedging, directly addressing a key deterrent to investment in emerging markets. 
By mitigating currency risk without adding to sovereign debt, the arrangement enhances 
project bankability and demonstrates how MDB balance-sheet optimisation can attract 
private finance. Such approaches highlight the need for a broader shift from risk avoidance 
to active risk management in global climate finance.
10.77	 These outcomes highlight structural weaknesses in the international financial 
system. Current global capital allocation often overlooks the long-term benefits of 
investing in climate solutions, as well as the role of public policy and international 
cooperation. As a result, developing countries must manage their climate action-
related investments with shorter-term loans, higher risk premiums, and a greater need 
to utilise their own resources, which limits their ability to implement effective climate 
action.
10.78	 Developing countries’ climate efforts will depend on a range of systemic reforms 
that must be coordinated across MDB mandates, global regulations, blended finance 
tools, and domestic financial systems. These changes can help align climate action 
with development goals, support economic resilience, and encourage inclusive growth. 
However, it is important that such adjustments do not divert capital away from other 
development priorities. 
10.79	 Blended finance tools, particularly those involving government support, should 
be utilised with caution. While such instruments help in attracting private investment, 
they also create fiscal trade-offs for governments. Using public sector funds to de-
risk climate projects for private investors can create liabilities and put more pressure 
on the limited fiscal space if the risks materialise. Strategies for scaling finance for 
climate action should strike a balance between attracting investment and the need for 
fiscal responsibility, transparency, and long-term debt sustainability. In that regard, 
it is to be mindful of the fact that excessive use of foreign currency borrowing also 
exposes projects to exchange rate risks, increasing forex premiums and financing costs, 
ultimately impacting consistency in climate action. Strong governance frameworks 
are necessary to ensure that climate finance supports growth and resilience without 
compromising macroeconomic stability.

Regulation: Streamlining environmental governance for growth
10.80	 Environmental regulation finds its theoretical basis in welfare economics, 
recognising pollution as a negative externality that leads to market failure if left 
unchecked. Environmental regulation assumes a central role, not merely to correct 
these market failures, but to enable sustainable growth. 
10.81	 Traditionally, environmental regulation has been guided by Pigouvian welfare 
economics,106 command-and-control approaches, which prescribe emission standards 
or technology norms that provide certainty but often impose high compliance costs and 
weak incentives for innovations.107 This approach often entails higher compliance costs 
and may weaken incentives for innovation. In contrast, market-based instruments, 
such as pollution taxes, tradable permits, and emissions trading, offer greater flexibility 
and cost-efficiency. More recent regulatory theories,108 including the toolkit prepared 
by OECD,109 emphasise risk and outcome-based regulation, calibrating stringency to 
environmental risk and assessing compliance by results rather than processes. Thus, 
well-designed regulations can reduce unnecessary burdens, promote innovation, and 
reconcile environmental protection with ease of doing business.110 
Evolution of Environmental Regulation in India
10.82	 Environmental policymaking in India gained momentum in the aftermath of the 
1972 Stockholm Declaration. This led to the enactment of the Water (Prevention and 
Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, which laid the institutional foundation for pollution 
control by establishing State-level Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) to prevent and 
control water pollution. These Boards were vested with the authority to initiate suo-
motu action against violations of environmental laws. To complement this framework, 
the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977, was introduced, 
enabling the levy of a cess on polluting and water-intensive industries based on their 
water consumption. 
10.83	 The Bhopal Gas Tragedy of 1984 marked a critical turning point in India’s 
environmental governance with the enactment of the Environment (Protection) Act, 
1986 (EPA). The EPA functions as an umbrella legislation that confers powers on the 
central government to regulate environmental pollution, enforce compliance, and issue 
subordinate rules and notifications. The three core statutes, i.e., the Water Act, the Air

Act, and the EPA, established the command and control framework for environmental 
regulation in India. In addition, the introduction of the Environmental Impact 
Assessment (EIA) Notification, 1994, and its replacement by the EIA Notification, 2006, 
institutionalised ex-ante environmental regulation.111 The EIA regime requires prior 
environmental clearance for specified categories of projects, incorporating screening, 
scoping, public consultation, and expert appraisal. Judicial intervention has played a 
significant role in shaping environmental regulation in India. The establishment of the 
National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2010 strengthened enforcement but also increased 
regulatory scrutiny and litigation risks
10.84	 Over time, in India, more flexible, incentive-based mechanisms have been 
introduced. At the national level, the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, which 
was launched in 2012, introduced a baseline-and-credit system that creates tradable 
Energy Saving Certificates (ESCerts) for industrial units that outperform their energy 
efficiency targets, incentivising innovation and cost-effective efficiency improvements 
rather than just imposing fixed standards. Recently, the framework for the Indian carbon 
market under the CCTS has been formulated. Yet another is the ETS for particulate 
matter, the first of its kind in the world, launched in Surat, Gujarat  (Box X.9). 
Box X.9: Do Pollution Trading Schemes Work in Developing Countries? 
In the United States and the European Union, pollution markets have been widely praised for 
translating sound economic theory into effective environmental policy. However, progress 
has been limited in developing countries. This is due to the assumption that market-based 
environmental regulations are rare in developing economies, and state capacity is also 
weak. In addition, regulators in developing countries often struggle to monitor emissions 
effectively and may lack the credibility or enforcement power required to ensure that 
polluters hold permits for every unit of emissions. 
However, the seminal work by Greenstone et al (2023)112 sets aside this argument and 
provides the first experimental evaluation of a particulate matter emissions trading market, 
the first of its kind globally implemented in a large Indian city of Gujarat (Surat). The 
scheme covered 317 industrial plants and was supported by the mandatory installation of 
Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) for large particulate sources. The  The 
programme replaced a conventional command-and-control framework based on technology 
requirements and concentration standards. The findings brought out that (a) the market 
functioned effectively, with active permit trading and near universal compliance, (b) 
plants participating in the emissions market reduced particulate emissions by 20-30 per 
cent compared to plants regulated under the status quo regime and (c) for a given level of

emissions, the market reduced abatement costs by 11–14 per cent, reflecting differences in 
firms’ marginal abatement costs. 
This suggests that when supported by credible monitoring infrastructure, pollution markets 
can deliver significant emissions reductions at lower compliance costs even in lower-capacity 
settings.
Recent reforms in Environmental Clearance and Related 
Regulations113  include:
10.85	 Rationalisation and predictability in regulations have been a specific area of 
concern for the government. India’s environmental regulatory framework is undergoing 
a gradual shift towards a governance model that involves expanding risk-based and 
outcome-oriented regulations, increasing the use of market-based instruments, 
strengthening the capacity and accountability of SPCBs, and enhancing regulatory 
predictability. Even so, several critical challenges remain, including the multiplicity 
of clearances and overlapping jurisdictions, weak post-clearance monitoring, capacity 
constraints within SPCB, significant inter-state variation in implementation, and high 
litigation-related uncertainty. 
10.86	 The Government of India has undertaken numerous measures to reform 
environmental governance, aligning environmental protection, climate commitments, 
and ease of doing business. These reforms focus on simplifying approvals, strengthening 
compliance, leveraging digital technologies, and transitioning to a trust-based, outcome-
oriented regulatory framework.
10.87	 At the centre of this transformation is PARIVESH (Pro-Active and Responsive 
facilitation by Interactive, Virtuous, and Environmental Single Window Hub) 3.0, a 
nationwide single-window digital platform for environmental clearances and post-
approval compliance monitoring. The system integrates baseline environmental data, 
compensatory afforestation land banks, inter-ministerial dashboards, and AI-enabled 
24×7 support, significantly improving transparency, predictability, and administrative 
efficiency.
10.88	 Compliance oversight has been strengthened through the Environment Audit 
Rules, 2025, which have introduced certified third-party environmental auditors 
under major environmental statutes. This reform enhances credibility while reducing 
procedural burden on regulators. In parallel, following amendments of the Water Act 
and the Air Act, the Government of India has issued uniform guidelines for the grant of 
consent to establish and operate for industries across all SPCBs in the country.

10.89	 Environmental regulations have been rationalised based on pollution potential. 
Industry classifications have been updated to Red, Orange, Green, Blue, and White114 
categories, to promote transition towards better compliance. Compressed Bio-gas 
(CBG) plants (excluding those using industrial/process waste) are classified as Blue; 
those generating by-products using electricity fall under White.  
10.90	 Given the strategic importance of critical minerals and to support development 
in line with climate priorities of India, regulations related to mining projects of Critical, 
Strategic, and Atomic Minerals have been streamlined.115 
10.91	 Ecosystem-based approaches and restoration are being incentivised through 
the Afforestation and Green Credit Programme that encourages public and private 
participation in compensatory afforestation and degraded forest restoration. Circular 
economy goals are being advanced through Circular Economy Action Plans covering

establish a framework for identifying and remedying contaminated sites. Biological 
Diversity (Access to Biological Resources and Knowledge Associated thereto and Fair

10.94	 The Public Liability Insurance Act amended through the Jan Vishwas Act 
decriminalises offences through penalty in place of imprisonment and relief/
compensation for deaths/fatalities in case of accidents was increased from ₹ 25,000/- 
to ₹ 5 lakh. It allows utilisation of the Environmental Relief Fund of ₹ 1,100 crore for 
the remediation of contaminated sites. The rates of relief were shifted from the Act to 
the rules to ensure greater flexibility. Through this act, the Ministry has decriminalised 
"the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) 
Act, 1981 and the Indian Forest Act, 1927. Apart from it, "Water" being a subject falling 
under the "State List", the criminal Provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control 
of Pollution) Act, 1974 have been amended under Article 252(1) of the Constitution of 
India. All the above four Acts have been decriminalised and have rationalised minor 
offences to further enhance trust-based governance for ease of living and doing business.
10.95	  In October 2025,119 green belt requirements for industries were rationalised 
based on the pollution potential of industrial estates/parks and individual industries, 
eliminating previous norms that required an overall green cover of 33 per cent of the 
industrial estates. The new norms require more polluting industries to have a greater 
green cover. 
10.96	 Collectively, these reforms are streamlining approvals, reducing compliance 
costs, strengthening monitoring, and thereby aligning environmental governance with 
India’s development and climate objectives. These reforms also represent a decisive 
shift toward trust-based environmental governance.

Kerala has, under the BRAP 2024,120 streamlined business registration, digitised land

renewable energy adoption, carbon-neutral gram panchayats, and waterbody rejuvenation.121 
Tamil Nadu has enhanced the ease of doing business through single-window clearances, 
digitised approvals, and land reforms, while promoting solar parks, district-level 
decarbonization plans, and energy efficiency programs. The Tamil Nadu Pollution 
Control Board actively monitors industrial effluent treatment systems and supports 
the establishment of Common Effluent Treatment Plants for clusters of small-scale and 
pollution-intensive industries, such as tanneries and textile units, to ensure treated 
wastewater meets prescribed environmental standards before discharge.122  Andhra 
Pradesh, in BRAP 2024, implemented single-window industrial clearances, online land 
registration, and e-environmental approvals. Recently, Andhra Pradesh has expanded its 
Online Consent Management & Monitoring System, allowing firms to apply for consents 
and track approvals digitally, reducing delays and enhancing data transparency between 
industry and the Pollution Control Board.123
Conclusion: Towards a green, resilient and competitive India 
10.97	 According to the synthesis report by UNFCCC, which compares the NDC 
targets of countries with their self-reported emission projections for 2030, none of 
the developed countries were on track to meet their 2030 emission reduction targets 
with their mitigation actions in 2020,124 despite having an abundance of means of 
implementation – finance and technology. Even the new NDCs for 2035 of major 
developed economies show only limited enhancement in their climate mitigation goals, 
backpedalling on their commitments under the Paris Agreement, despite the fact that 
these countries reached their peak emissions decades ago, vis-à-vis developing countries 
like India. To add to the weakening of global efforts against climate change, the climate 
finance commitments to the developing countries continue to remain diluted. The clear 
signals from the global north, which are dithering on their own climate action, warrant 
that India must place adaptation centre stage in India’s climate action story to ensure 
that development gains are not lost.

10.98	 The chapter underscores that climate action is no longer an environmental add-
on but a core component of India’s development strategy. For India, adaptation has 
rightly emerged as the cornerstone of climate-resilient growth, delivered primarily 
through public investment, state-led planning, and community institutions. The 
evolution of SAPCCs from mitigation-oriented documents to development-integrated 
adaptation frameworks reflects a growing recognition that resilience outcomes—such 
as water security, stable livelihoods, disaster risk reduction, and ecosystem services—
are best achieved through locally grounded and institutionally embedded interventions.
10.99	  India has not yet reached its peak energy demand, and ensuring energy access, 
affordability, and security remains central to our development pathway. India’s mitigation 
strategy reflects pragmatism rather than prescriptiveness. Rapid growth in renewable 
energy, advances in energy efficiency, expansion of nuclear power, development of 
green hydrogen, strengthening of carbon sinks, and the operationalisation of carbon 
markets demonstrate how mitigation can be aligned with energy security, industrial 
competitiveness, and job creation. India’s approach acknowledges the limits of one-
size-fits-all transitions and emphasises system reliability, affordability, and domestic 
manufacturing capabilities. 
10.100	Climate finance remains the binding constraint. The gap between global capital 
availability and climate investment needs in developing countries reflects structural 
weaknesses in the international financial architecture rather than a lack of ambition 
or bankable projects. India’s experience highlights the importance of robust domestic 
financial markets, strong development banks, effective municipal finance, and credible 
regulatory frameworks. However, domestic resources alone cannot meet the required 
investment scale. Reforms to multilateral development banks, the greater use of risk-
sharing and blended finance, recalibration of credit rating practices, and predictable 
concessional finance are essential to lowering the cost of capital and attracting private 
investment. 
10.101	Raising climate ambition in India—especially on mitigation—without 
corresponding support in finance and technology is neither realistic nor equitable. A 
credible and orderly transition from fossil fuels depends on the timely availability of 
reliable, non-fossil energy sources such as nuclear power, alongside a well-defined 
peak-emissions pathway. There could be a push towards establishing a credible national 
platform, backed by predictable and adequate international finance, that can help us 
develop climate projects, enhance their bankability, and enable the required climate 
action. This, in some ways, would balance climate action ambitions with the need for 
secure energy in the absence of viable scalable options. In the context of such a national 
platform, the focus could be on scaling up innovative mitigation and adaptation

technologies, as well as on research and development, led through collaboration with 
institutions and partners from developed countries. 
10.102 Environmental regulation is increasingly becoming a facilitator of sustainable 
growth. India's thoughtful transition toward risk-based regulation, market-oriented 
instruments, digital compliance systems, and a framework of trust-based governance 
highlights the potential for environmental protection to coexist harmoniously with 
improved business operations. Insights from various Indian states indicate that 
factors such as regulatory predictability, administrative capacity, and the adoption of 
technology are crucial
10.103	Taken together, the chapter highlights that India’s climate pathway is anchored 
in development realism. Climate action is pursued not through abrupt transitions 
or externally imposed models, but through adaptive institutions, domestic capacity 
building, and policy coherence. As climate risks intensify and global transitions 
accelerate, India’s experience offers a development-centric framework, one that 
integrates resilience, competitiveness, and sustainability, demonstrating that economic 
growth and environmental stewardship can advance together rather than in opposition.
