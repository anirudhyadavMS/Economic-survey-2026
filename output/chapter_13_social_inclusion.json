    "India’s pursuit of inclusive growth under the development model of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Prayas, Sabka Vishwas’ has yielded measurable gains in recent years, reflected in sustained poverty reduction, narrowing inequalities, and improved access to basic services. Rural transformation has played a central role in this progress, driven by infrastructure investments, reforms in employment frameworks, the adoption of technology, and enhanced participation of local governments, and community institutions.",
    "Inclusive development in India emphasises fairness, dignity, and equal rights for all, with the empowerment of vulnerable and marginalised groups at its core.",
    "Government affirmative action in education, healthcare, skill development, and livelihoods has facilitated social and economic mobility for the most vulnerable.",
    "Importantly, the development narrative is shifting from government-led schemes to community-driven initiatives, enabling local voices to shape solutions, and making growth more participatory, meaningful, and sustainable."
