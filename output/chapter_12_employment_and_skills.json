Training dedicated counsellors and integrating Tele-MANAS with school and college systems can improve access, normalise help-seeking, and enable early intervention.",
    "OUTLOOK 11.78. India's health and education sectors require unwavering focus to unlock the nation's true potential, especially in addressing interconnected new emerging issues such as the double burden of CDs and NCDs, increasing digital addiction, concerning mental health issues, poor nutrition, and increasing obesity. Together, they threaten the demographic dividend by perpetuating cycles of unemployment, inequality, and lost productivity. Open acknowledgement and constructive public discussion are important initial steps in addressing these challenges and promoting effective solutions.",

    "11.79. Technology-driven surveys using platforms like the UDISE+, AISHE, ABDM and integration of AI tools can identify 'health hotspots' such as prevalence of obesity in urban slums or rising digital addiction in peri-urban schools. Public-private partnership can help develop frontline workers-led initiatives in India, employing technology like mobile apps, AI chatbots (ASHABot166), and digital dashboards (e.g., ASHA Kirana's",

    "11.80. In sum, prioritising education, skilling, digital wellness, health, nutrition, and dietary habits through open dialogue, feedback surveys, success stories, and relatable role models will forge resilient citizens. This holistic approach would ensure a healthier, educated, skilled, thriving India.",

    "India's workforce of over 56 crore holds tremendous potential for its economic growth. Labour market indicators point to a steady job market, with improving labour force participation, declining unemployment, and robust job creation in both the organised and unorganised sectors.",
    "To fully harness the demographic dividend, creating quality jobs with sustainable livelihoods is essential. The government has been working towards creating decent employment opportunities through structural reforms and targeted interventions. The recently enacted Labour Codes aim to strike a balance between flexibility and workers' rights, focusing on ensuring industry competitiveness while promoting worker welfare. Structural barriers to female participation are being addressed through the provision of safe, affordable accommodation and flexible and hybrid work arrangements. There is a growing focus on expanding social security, income protection, and grievance redressal mechanisms for gig and platform workers to safeguard their well-being. While addressing the quantity of labour, it is equally important to improve its quality, as economic growth relies on both the size and capabilities of its labour force.",
    "To achieve this, opportunities for vocational education at all levels are vital for strengthening the skill ecosystem and realising the Viksit Bharat's vision."

Competing globally requires not only capital and technology but also a focus on labour, including worker well-being, gender inclusivity, and harnessing the demographic dividend. Labour is crucial to the sector’s expansion, with 11.4 per cent of total employment in the manufacturing sector in 2023-24.47 About 1.9 crore persons are employed in the organised manufacturing sector48, while about 3.3 crore persons are employed in the unorganised manufacturing sector.49 Enhancing worker participation is essential for enhancing productivity and sustainable long-term growth."

Research shows that financial pressures reduce cognitive bandwidth and are nearly five times more likely to be a source of distraction at work.54,55,56 To address this, an EWA intervention could help manage financial stress, improve employee retention and worker welfare.57 Evidence from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) from March 2023 to October 2024, involving over 800 women workers, found that access to liquidity led to substantial gains in well-being.
