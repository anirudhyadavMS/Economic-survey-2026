SERVICES: FROM STABILITY 
TO NEW FRONTIERS
This chapter offers a comprehensive analysis of India's evolving services 
sector, which has become the principal engine of economic growth, resilience, 
and structural transformation. Against a backdrop of global uncertainty and 
subdued global industrial activity, the services sector has emerged as a stabilising 
force, contributing more than half of India’s Gross Value Added and serving 
as a major driver of exports and employment. The chapter situates India’s 
performance within global trends, highlighting the sector’s rapid expansion in 
digitally delivered, knowledge-intensive, and experience-led segments, as well 
as its comparative strength in trade and foreign direct investment.
Through a detailed examination of recent developments and high-frequency 
indicators, the chapter demonstrates how services have underpinned economic 
momentum, buffered external shocks, and supported urban employment 
dynamics. Sub-sector analyses-spanning tourism, IT and IT-enabled services, 
transport, telecommunications, real estate, media and entertainment, and space 
services-reveal both the diversity and the emerging opportunities within the 
sector. The discussion brings out critical reform measures, including developing 
new niche areas like the Orange economy, new hiking trails, marina development 
and Ocean commercialisation so that India’s services sector remains a powerful 
engine of sustained and inclusive economic growth in the years ahead.
INTRODUCTION
7.1.	 The global economy is undergoing a structural shift marked by the ascendance 
of the services sector as the principal engine of growth, resilience, and cross-border 
integration. In recent years, global output expansion has moderated, constrained by 
subdued industrial activity, supply-chain realignments, and heightened geopolitical 
uncertainty. Amid these headwinds, the services sector has emerged as a stabilising 
force, contributing more to the growth. Notably, while global goods trade has stagnated, 
services trade has continued to expand, reinforcing its role as a critical buffer against 
external shocks and volatility.1

7.2.	 The rapid expansion of digitally and remotely deliverable services has allowed the 
services sector to scale swiftly by transcending traditional geographical and operational 
constraints. This has enabled new forms of value creation, particularly in knowledge-
intensive and technology-enabled activities, helping even smaller economies leave a 
global imprint. In contrast to the typical manufacturing-led growth paths followed by 
other countries at a comparable stage of development, India has experienced service-
led growth at a significantly lower level of per capita income. 
7.3.	 Currently, India’s services sector contributes more than half of the Gross Value 
Added and serves as a major driver of exports and employment in the country. Not 
only does it continue to underpin domestic growth, but services have also emerged as 
the most stable and resilient component of GDP, acting as a high-growth, low-volatility 
anchor, as is the case across the globe. The sector has recorded average annual growth 
of around 7-8 per cent year after year, in sharp contrast to the more pronounced cyclical 
fluctuations observed in agriculture and industry.2 India is the world’s seventh-largest 
exporter of services, with its share in global services trade more than doubling from 
2 per cent in 2005 to 4.3 per cent in 20243, and the sector continues to be the largest 
recipient of foreign direct investment inflows.
7.4.	 Even as services continue to anchor growth, the rapid technological progress which 
helped services ascend scales is now outpacing the growth in firm-level and worker-
level adaptation, creating skill gaps and disruptions. Coupled with tighter immigration, 
data protection/localisation norms and remittance rules, the promise of being the 
‘stabilising force’ is now under challenge. 
7.5.	 Building on this context, the chapter first reviews global trends in the services 
sector, placing India’s performance in an international context. It then assesses recent 
developments in India’s services sector during the current year, followed by an analysis 
of performance across major sub-sectors, highlighting key strengths and emerging 
opportunities. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the main challenges and 
policy priorities for sustaining services-led growth.

delivered services, including IT, finance, and professional services. This has thereby 
reshaped the structure and growth dynamics of the services sector. Since the latter is 
of high value, this compositional shift post-pandemic has raised the share of services 
in global gross value added, even as overall services growth has moderated relative 
to the pre-pandemic period (2015-19).4 India has followed this trajectory with greater 
momentum relative to most peers (Chart VII.1). For instance, as per World Bank data, 
India’s share of services in GDP rose by about 1.5 percentage points above its pre-
pandemic average to reach 49.9 per cent in 2024, an increase larger than that observed 
globally and across major advanced economies.

7.7.	 As mentioned above, notwithstanding the rising share of services in GDP, services 
growth in the post-pandemic period has faced headwinds from slower global growth, 
weaker expansion of trade and investment-linked services, and subdued productivity 
gains, particularly in labour-intensive segments. China has experienced the sharpest 
deceleration among major economies. India, by contrast, has remained relatively 
resilient, with services growth in 2024 staying close to its pre-pandemic levels 
(Chart VII.2).

corresponds to calendar year 2015-19) and the post-pandemic period is assessed using FY23-FY25, with FY21 
and FY22 excluded due to base effects arising from the COVID shock.

Shifts in trade and capital flows in the services sector
7.8.	 These structural shifts are increasingly evident in global services trade patterns. In 
2024, the share of services trade in GDP rose relative to pre-pandemic levels, signalling 
a gradual, though uneven, rebalancing of global trade towards services. Underscoring 
its comparative strength in digitally deliverable and globally tradable services, India 
recorded a relatively stronger expansion in services trade as a share of GDP compared 
to its pre-pandemic average (Chart VII.3), while several advanced economies saw only 
marginal gains or slight declines.

7.9.	 This growing role of services in global trade has been mirrored by a corresponding 
shift in capital allocation. Services accounted for an average 53.5 per cent of global 
FDI5 during 2022-2024, up from 50.9 per cent in the pre-pandemic period, with 
inflows becoming increasingly concentrated. Energy and gas supply, information and 
communication, construction, and transportation together absorbed over 88 per cent 
of services FDI, compared to 75.5 per cent before the pandemic (Chart VII.4). Further, 
it is observed that global services FDI had a relatively balanced structure pre-COVID 
with allocation reasonably spread out across these sectors. However, post-COVID 
(2022-2024), FDI flows have been skewed towards a more energy-centric and strategic 
profile. This reflects a growing investor preference for services linked to energy security, 
digital connectivity, infrastructure, and supply chains.

7.10.	 India’s experience broadly mirrors these global trends. Services-sector FDI 
inflows6 accounted for an average 80.2 per cent of total FDI during FY23-FY25, up from 
77.7 per cent in the pre-pandemic period (FY16-FY20), underscoring the growing role 
of services in attracting foreign investment. These inflows remain highly concentrated, 
led by information and communication services (25.8 per cent) and professional 
services (23.8 per cent), reflecting India’s strength in digital and knowledge-intensive 
activities. Finance and insurance (14.2 per cent), energy and gas (12.8 per cent), and 
trading (12.2 per cent) also drew significant investment. Together, these segments

accounted for nearly 89 per cent of services FDI, highlighting the dominance of digital, 
skill-intensive, and infrastructure-linked services in India’s investment profile.
RECENT TRENDS IN INDIA’S SERVICE SECTOR 
PERFORMANCE
Services sector underpins economic growth in H1 FY26
7.11.		 The discussion so far highlights that, in recent years, India’s services sector 
has performed relatively strongly in comparison to global developments. The current 
year, however, has been marked by heightened uncertainty and shifts in geopolitical 
alignments across countries. Despite these conditions, the services sector in India 
gained momentum in H1 FY26, with its share in GDP rising to 53.6 per cent, higher 
than that in H1 FY25 and the pre-pandemic period (H1 FY16-H1 FY20) (Chart VII.5). 
Underlying this acceleration is the growth in services GVA by 9.3 per cent in H1 FY26, 
up from 7.0 per cent in the corresponding period of FY25.

7.12.		 Sub-sector data reveal that the ‘financial, real estate, and professional services’ 
sector remains the key driver of service growth. The growth was supported by sustained 
demand for credit, business services, and real estate-linked activities, with both growth 
and GVA share exceeding pre-pandemic levels. ‘Public administration, defence and 
other services’ have also continued to expand at a pace above pre-pandemic trends, 
underpinned by steady public spending and service delivery. In contrast, ‘trade, 
hospitality, transport, communication and related services’ have seen a more gradual 
normalisation, with growth broadly close to pre-pandemic averages. However, its 
overall contribution is yet to fully recover, reflecting ongoing adjustments in contact-
intensive and mobility-dependent activities.

7.13.		 While H1 FY26 performance highlights the near-term resilience of services, Box 
VII.1 situates these developments within a longer-term structural transformation of the 
sector, drawing on recent evidence from NITI Aayog.
Box VII.1: NITI’s findings on state-level and sector-level dynamics
In October 2025, NITI Aayog7  undertook a first-of-its-kind disaggregation of India’s services 
sector into 15 major sub-sectors, offering a decadal assessment of structural transformation 
across output, employment and regional dynamics. The two-volume report highlights 
the emergence of services not only as the largest contributor to output, but also as a key 
transmission channel linking economic growth, employment generation, urbanisation and 
state-level convergence. While services have expanded faster than the overall economy, 
their capacity to absorb labour is not insignificant, contrary to general perceptions, though 
employment is increasingly uneven across sub-sectors and states.
Services account for around 30 per cent of total employment, substantially higher than 
manufacturing and construction, which employ about 11-12 per cent each, implying that 
services now employ more people than industry as a whole. Over 2011-2024, employment 
elasticity in services stood at 0.43, compared with 0.22 in manufacturing, 0.41 in agriculture, 
and 0.60 in construction. Services added nearly 40 million jobs over the past six years, 
with employment elasticity rising to 0.63 in the post-COVID recovery phase, second only to 
construction, underscoring the sector’s role as a labour shock absorber.
At the same time, a services employment-output paradox is becoming evident. Rapid GVA 
growth in high-end services has not translated proportionately into job creation, due to their 
high skill intensity and automation. Consequently, most new employment continues to be

generated in low-value-added subsectors like trade, hospitality, transport and personal 
services. Globally, as per ILO data, the share of workers employed in services rose from 35.5 
per cent in 1992 to 49.8 per cent in 2022 (14.3 percentage points increase), with sharper 
increases in upper-middle-income countries (which saw 21.8 percentage point increase). 
India’s transition has been more gradual, with services employment rising from 22.1 per 
cent to 30.0 per cent over the same period (an 8.9 percentage point increase). However, 
with 51.5 per cent of service workers in regular wage employment, compared with 1 per cent 
in agriculture and 25.5 per cent in industry, the job quality in services remains superior.
Between 2011-12 and 2023-24, traditional segments such as trade and repair, and 
professional, scientific and business services, maintained GVA shares of around 20 per cent 
each. In contrast, computer and information services more than doubled their GVA share 
from 6.0 per cent to 12.2 per cent. Pension and insurance services declined from 1.7 per cent 
to 1.1 per cent, while other financial services remained stable at about 10 per cent. Education 
recorded a modest increase from 6.7 per cent to 7.4 per cent; health remained broadly stable 
at around 2.8 per cent; and sectors such as telecommunications, audiovisual services, postal 
and courier services, and travel saw marginal declines. Transport, cultural and recreational 
services experienced sharper reductions in their GVA shares.
This diversity is mirrored in state-level performances. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil 
Nadu and Telangana together account for nearly 40 per cent of services output, driven by 
modern, high-productivity services such as IT, finance and professional services, resulting 
in a concentration of output in highly urbanised states, particularly in southern India.8 At 
the same time, important contrasts persist. Bihar, despite low per capita income, derives 
58.7 per cent of its GVA from services, largely from low-value-added activities. Kerala, with 
64.3 per cent of GSVA from services, remains reliant on traditional segments such as trade, 
tourism and real estate. In some cases, the services share declined, challenging the notion of 
one-way transition towards services: Odisha’s services share declined from 38.5 per cent to 
34.9 per cent, while Assam’s fell from 46.5 per cent to 34.3 per cent over the period.
Services employment in India remains predominantly urban, with over 60 per cent of urban 
workers engaged in services, compared with less than 20 per cent in rural areas. Gender 
disparities persist, particularly in rural services employment, where only 10.5 per cent of 
women are engaged in services, compared with nearly 60 per cent in urban areas. At the 
same time, select sub-sectors show notable reversals in wage gaps. In information and 
communication services, urban women earn about ₹2,000 per day, compared with ₹729 for 
men. Similar patterns are observed in healthcare (₹542 for women versus ₹480 for men), 
and in rural education and public administration, where female wages exceed those of male 
counterparts.
Services sector remains central to urban employment dynamics
7.14.		 PLFS data for the first two quarters of FY26 show that the share of services in 
urban employment rose to 61.9 per cent (on average), marginally higher than the FY21-
8 	 Delhi has a higher service share in GVA, however, arising from greater presence of public administration, being 
the capital city-state.

FY22 average of 61.7 per cent, a period marked by relatively strong services-sector 
hiring during the pandemic (Chart VII.7a). Consistent with this, EPFO data for April-
July FY26 indicate sustained formal job creation, with services accounting for 51.7 per 
cent of net employment additions (Chart VII.7b), led by expert services, trading and 
commercial establishments, and cleaning services. Together, these trends underscore 
the central role of services in strengthening labour market resilience amid global 
uncertainty.

High-frequency indicators signal steady growth in H2 of FY26
7.15.		 High-frequency indicators suggest a continued strengthening of service activity 
in Q3 FY26. The PMI Services Index remained firmly in the expansionary territory 
(marked by a reading above 50), averaging 58.9 during Q3 of FY26. This was driven 
by robust domestic demand, as reflected in the new business intakes that remained 
well above their long-run average of 53.3 (Chart VII.8). International sales also 
continued to expand to 53.5, above the long-period average of 48.5, although the pace 
of growth moderated to a four-quarter low, amid heightened global competition and 
protectionism.

7.16.		 Bank credit growth in services has remained supportive in recent months, with 
the pace of expansion moving closer to its five-year average of ~14 per cent (Chart VII.9) 
after the cyclical downturn and sharp recovery during the pre- and post-pandemic 
periods. From an average 9.9 per cent growth during April-September 2025, credit 
to the services sector strengthened further, registering an average growth of 12.4 per 
cent year-on-year in October-November 2025. This acceleration was largely driven by 
a rebound in lending to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs), supported by 
rising demand from the retail and MSME segments, aided by the rationalisation of 
GST rates. Credit flows to other service segments, such as tourism, hotels, restaurants, 
and trade, have also gained momentum. Credit growth and GVA growth in services 
are fairly positively correlated. Overall, these trends indicate that financing conditions 
have remained responsive to evolving demand conditions in the services sector.

Services exports as a buffer amid global uncertainty
7.17.		 Mirroring global trends, services exports have become a central pillar of India’s 
external sector and a key driver of growth. Their share in GDP averaged 9.7 per cent 
during FY23-FY25,9 up from 7.4 per cent in the pre-pandemic period (Chart VII.10a). 
Amid subdued global goods trade due to policy uncertainty and geopolitical disruptions, 
services exports have provided a critical buffer. This role has strengthened further in 
H1 FY26, with the share of services exports in GDP rising to 10.0 per cent, from 9.7 per 
cent in H1 FY25.
7.18.	 The growing role of India’s services exports is reflected in the marked acceleration 
in its growth over recent years. Average growth in services exports has more than 
doubled from 7.6 per cent in the pre-pandemic period (FY16-FY20) to 14.0 per cent 
during FY23-FY25, reflecting strong and broad-based global demand for Indian 
services. Amid increasingly competitive conditions in global services markets and 
heightened policy uncertainty, services export growth moderated to 8.0 per cent during 
FY26 (April-November). Notwithstanding this moderation, growth has remained above 
pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the underlying momentum in services exports has 
been maintained.

7.19.		 The composition of services exports further reinforces this assessment (Chart 
VII.10b). Software services, accounting for over 40 per cent of total services exports, 
remain the primary growth driver, expanding at an average rate of 13.5 per cent 
during FY23-FY25 compared to 4.7 per cent in FY16-FY20, supported by strong global

demand for digital services. Professional and management consulting services have 
emerged as the second-largest contributor, driven by a more than doubled growth rate 
of 25.9 per cent, resulting in an increase in their share from 10.5 per cent in FY16-
FY20 to 18.3 per cent in FY23-FY25. Together, these segments account for over 65 per 
cent of services exports, highlighting India’s growing specialisation in cross-border, 
knowledge-intensive activities. Sustaining services export growth will depend on 
continued diversification within services and further movement up the value chain, 
in line with evolving global demand patterns and regulatory environments. In this 
context, Box VII.2 examines the role of artificial intelligence in shaping India’s services 
export performance, highlighting the differential impact of AI adoption across services 
segments and its implications for India’s growing specialisation in digitally deliverable, 
knowledge-intensive exports. 
Box VII.2: Artificial Intelligence and India’s Services Exports
Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly shaping global services trade, particularly digitally 
deliverable services. Emerging evidence suggests a two-way relationship between AI 
innovation and trade: advances in AI reduce trade costs and increase productivity, while 
increased cross-border services trade, in turn, accelerates technological diffusion. The 
WTO estimates that AI could raise global trade by 34-37 per cent by 2040, with digitally 
deliverable services expanding by about 42 per cent, driven by lower trade costs and higher 
productivity.10 Conversely, a 10 per cent increase in digitally deliverable services trade 
is associated with a 2.6 per cent rise in cross-border AI patent citations across borders, 
underscoring the mutually reinforcing nature of trade and AI-driven innovation. India is 
well positioned to benefit from these trends, supported by a strong IT-BPM ecosystem and 
a rapidly expanding AI talent base. According to Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence 
Index Report 2025, India recorded the largest increase in AI talent among major economies 
between 2016 and 2024.
To assess the impact of AI on India’s services trade, the Survey undertook an analysis using a 
two-way fixed effects difference-in-difference (DiD) framework using quarterly RBI balance 
of payments data for Q1:FY18 to Q2:FY26.11 The analysis compares presumably AI-intensive 
services-software, business, and financial services-with less AI-exposed services, including 
travel, transport, insurance, government services n.e.c., and communication services, with 
Q2 FY23 as the intervention period. 
The analysis reveals that AI-intensive services exports grew significantly faster than less AI-
exposed services after the AI diffusion phase. The estimated coefficient implies, on average, 
an approximate 39.5 per cent increase in exports of the AI-exposed (treated) categories 
relative to the other (control) categories.

All. Geneva: WTO, https://tinyurl.com/mwz3nfwc
11 The regressions were estimated in logarithmic form, allowing coefficients to be interpreted as approximate 
percentage changes while mitigating scale differences across service categories. Formal tests find no evidence 
of differential pre-intervention trends between the treatment and control groups, supporting the validity of the 
DiD framework.

Trade agreements for promoting services 
7.20.	 As India’s services exports expand and move up the value chain, trade policy has 
become central to facilitating cross-border delivery and reducing regulatory frictions. 
India has increasingly leveraged free trade agreements, comprehensive economic 
partnerships, and bilateral engagements to enhance market access and competitiveness, 
with a focus on professional mobility, regulatory cooperation, and digital trade. Amid 
the realignment of global trade relationships, ongoing and completed agreements aim 
to further ease barriers and support services exports. An overview of these initiatives is 
presented in Box VII.3 below.

7.21.		 The contribution of services exports is well established in terms of output, 
external balances and competitiveness. A complementary consideration is the nature 
of their wider institutional spillovers, particularly whether export dynamism creates 
economy-wide incentives for improvements in execution capacity. Box VII.4 examines 
this question, focusing on differences in the way goods and services connect to system-
wide public infrastructure and regulatory capabilities.
BoxVII.4: Can the export of services help improve state capacity?
The claim that services exports cannot play the same disciplining role as goods exports is not 
a judgment about their economic value or sophistication. It is a claim about how different 
forms of production interact with institutions, incentives, and state capacity. The distinction 
is structural, not sectoral.
The disciplining effect that matters is whether success and failure in a sector transmit 
pressure back into the wider system, forcing firms to abandon influence-seeking strategies 
and compelling the state to upgrade its execution capacity because incompetence becomes 
fiscally, politically, and macroeconomically costly. Historically, services exports have not 
transmitted that pressure.
The first reason is that services exports are inherently firm-selective rather than system-
forcing. A globally competitive services firm can operate at high efficiency while largely 
bypassing the domestic institutional environment. Software, design, consulting, finance, 
and digital services rely primarily on human capital, bandwidth, legal contracting, and 
reputation. They do not require ports to function efficiently, customs to clear on time, 
industrial land to be assembled at scale, or municipal services to work reliably. As a result, 
services firms can succeed inside what is otherwise a weak or fragmented state. 
Because these firms do not depend on the weakest parts of the state, they have little incentive 
to force improvement in those areas. They adapt around institutional failure instead of 
confronting it. The state, in turn, faces no compulsion to upgrade because its failures do not 
immediately threaten export earnings, large-scale employment, or fiscal stability.
The second reason is that services exports allow exit without voice. That is, when goods 
exporters face domestic bottlenecks—such as ports, power, logistics, and inspection 
regimes—they must address them or fail. Their capital is sunk, their supply chains are 
rooted, and exit is costly and visible. Services firms, by contrast, can relocate teams, invoice 
through offshore entities, arbitrage jurisdictions, or simply shift work across borders with

Economic Survey 2025-26
274
274
relatively low friction. When institutions become burdensome, the most productive firms 
leave quietly. That behaviour is rational at the firm level but is unhelpful at the system level, 
because it removes precisely the actors who might otherwise pressure the state to improve.
The third reason is that services exports do not impose hard budget constraints on the state. 
Goods exports typically anchor large employment bases, supplier ecosystems, logistics 
networks, and regional economies. When they falter, the effects show up quickly in trade 
balances, employment numbers, bank balance sheets, and political pressure. On the other 
hand, services exports, even when large in foreign exchange terms, are far less employment-
intensive per dollar earned, geographically concentrated, and weakly linked to domestic 
supply chains. A slowdown hurts incomes in specific urban clusters but does not affect 
macroeconomic stability in the same way. 
The fourth and deeper reason is that services competition is skill-based rather than system-
based. In services, competitiveness is driven primarily by individual talent, firm culture, client 
relationships, and reputational capital. System quality matters at the margin, but it is not 
decisive. In goods manufacturing, competitiveness is inseparable from system performance, 
encompassing factors such as delivery times, cost discipline, standards compliance, logistics 
reliability, and infrastructure uptime. System failure translates directly and immediately 
into lost orders. 
The empirical record supports this distinction. India is the strongest real-world test. India 
has built globally competitive service exports over three decades, yet its broader institutional 
environment, encompassing urban governance, courts, regulatory discretion, land and 
labour administration, remains weak and uneven. 
There is also a more uncomfortable implication. Services exports can actively delay reform. 
By generating foreign exchange, increasing elite incomes, and creating pockets of prosperity, 
they alleviate balance-of-payments pressure and reduce the urgency for politically difficult 
changes. They act as a pressure valve, allowing the system to muddle through rather than 
confront its structural weaknesses. In theory, one could imagine a services-led disciplining 
path if services exports were mass-employment-intensive, geographically dispersed, heavily 
regulation-dependent, and if their failure created immediate macroeconomic consequences. 
In practice, no large economy has met these conditions. Digital services, by their nature, 
resist them.
The conclusion, stated precisely, is not that services exports are inferior or undesirable. 
They are extremely valuable for growth, foreign exchange, and firm-level excellence. The 
conclusion is narrower: services exports are structurally incapable of forcing system-wide 
state upgrading.
Servicification of manufacturing 
7.22.	 Beyond direct cross-border delivery, services are increasingly integrated into 
manufacturing through activities such as design, R&D, logistics, software development, 
and professional services, reflecting the growing “servicification” of production 
systems. This is evident in products such as smart devices, whose value is driven by 

Services: From Stability to New Frontiers
275
275
software ecosystems; medical equipment/wearables bundled with diagnostic and 
remote-monitoring services; and automobiles, which are increasingly described as 
“software on wheels”. As manufacturing becomes increasingly technology and data-
intensive, services such as ICT, finance, compliance, and after-sales support account 
for a growing share of value creation. International experience suggests that this 
integration is a crucial channel for enhancing value addition, export competitiveness, 
and employment. (see Box VII.5).
Box VII.5: Servicification of manufacturing - Global evidence 
and India’s emerging trajectory
Global evidence: services as a source of manufacturing value
Trade in value-added analysis15 with data up to 2022 shows that services contribute a much 
larger share to manufacturing exports than reflected in gross trade figures-nearly one-third 
in advanced economies and about one-quarter in developing economies. Services account 
for around 30 per cent of export value in sectors such as electronics, metals, machinery, 
and textiles, highlighting the growing reliance of modern manufacturing on service inputs.16 
International firm-level evidence17 further shows that manufacturers with higher service-
intensity tend to be more productive and export-oriented, with value creation increasingly 
concentrated in pre- and post-production activities such as design, R&D, logistics, and 
after-sales support. 18
Indian experience: exports and employment linkages
Firm-level studies for India19 indicate that greater use of service inputs is positively associated 
with export participation, export intensity, and more stable or even higher employment in 
manufacturing. Complementing this, an analysis by the Centre for Social and Economic 
Progress20 using OECD-TiVA and Indian input-output data shows that domestic services 
value added accounted for about 17.7 per cent of India’s manufacturing export value in 2020, 
with sectoral shares exceeding 20-25 per cent in electronics, metals, textiles and electrical 
equipment and 15 per cent or more in several labour-intensive industries.
15 	Based on computations from the OECD Trade in Value-Added (TiVA) database (2025) using the “origin of value 
added in gross exports” dataset. Services shares are derived as the ratio of services value added embodied in 
manufacturing exports to total value added in manufacturing exports.

18 	For instance, logistics, trade finance, legal services, marketing, and distribution services reduce fixed and variable 
costs of exporting (customs clearance, transport, payments, contracts), making export participation viable for 
more firms and supporting higher export intensity. Design, engineering, testing, certification, branding, and 
R&D services help firms move up the value chain by improving product quality, compliance with standards, and 
customization-key for entering and sustaining export markets. IT, data analytics, and risk-management services 
enhance demand forecasting, inventory control, and supplier diversification, helping firms absorb shocks and 
maintain export relationships-supporting export stability.

Policy-relevant considerations
Both global and Indian evidence underscore that the benefits of servicification depend 
on the efficiency of the services ecosystem. Improvements in logistics, transport, ICT, 
warehousing, and business services, along with reduced frictions in services trade, 
can enhance manufacturing competitiveness, export sophistication, and employment. 
Servicification thus highlights the complementarity between manufacturing and services, 
rather than the trade-offs, and offers India a pathway to raise manufacturing value addition 
while supporting jobs within a services-enabled growth framework.
SUB-SECTORAL PERFORMANCE AND DRIVERS
7.23.		 While recent trends highlight the increasing role of services in driving growth and 
exports, variations in demand drivers, exposure to global conditions, and the adoption of 
technology influence sub-sectoral performance. An examination of key services sub-sectors, 
therefore, provides deeper insight into the sources of growth, resilience, and emerging structural 
shifts within the services economy.
a.  Tourism Sector: Domestic resilience with emerging high-value 
segments 
7.24.	 Domestic tourism remained the backbone of the sector, with visits increasing by 
about 17.5 per cent in 2024 over the previous year (Chart VII.11a) and by nearly 52.7 
per cent during January-September 2025 compared with the corresponding period last 
year. International Tourist Arrivals (ITAs), including foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) and 
arrivals of non-resident Indians (NRIs), rose to 20.57 million, marking an increase of 8.9 
per cent over 2023 and 14.8 per cent above pre-pandemic levels (2019) (Chart VII.11b). 
Foreign tourist arrivals, however, remained below pre-pandemic levels, declining by 
about 11.8 per cent during January-October 2025 relative to the same period of the 
previous year (Chart VII.11b). This is in line with trends seen in the broader Asia-Pacific 
region21 and is also on account of growth weakness and political turmoil in key source 
destinations. High-frequency hospitality indicators suggest sustained momentum, 
driven by domestic tourism, with hotel occupancy rates consistently exceeding 60 per 
cent in recent years (Chart VII.11c).

7.25.	 As per the estimates of the Ministry of Tourism, in FY24, travel and tourism 
contributed 5.22 per cent to GDP, close to pre-pandemic levels, while supporting an 
estimated 8.46 crore direct and indirect jobs22, or about 13.3 per cent of total employment 
in the overall economy. Consistent with this growth, foreign exchange earnings from 
tourism rose to USD 35.0 billion in 2024, up 8.8 per cent from 2023.23 This reflects the 
labour-intensive nature of this sector and its strong linkages with transport, hospitality, 
trade, and allied services.
7.26.	 Supported by cost competitiveness, skilled medical professionals, and 
established healthcare infrastructure, medical and wellness tourism has emerged as 
a key comparative advantage for India, offering high-value and non-seasonal tourism. 
Medical tourist arrivals increased from about 1.12 lakh in 200924 to over 6 lakh during 
2022-2024, implying a CAGR of around 12.4 per cent, significantly above the overall 
inbound tourism growth of 4.5 per cent for the corresponding period. Consequently, 
medical tourism’s share in foreign tourist arrivals rose from about 2.2 per cent in 2009 
to around 6.5 per cent in 2024.25 Despite accounting for a modest share of total arrivals, 
medical tourists generate higher per-visitor spending and longer stays. Industry 
estimates place the medical tourism market at about USD 8.7 billion in 2025, with 
projections of USD 16.2 billion by 2030.26

7.27.	 Realising tourism potential in different regions and converting it into sustained 
economic outcomes, however, depends critically on implementation capacity at 
the State and local levels. Experiences across states underscore the importance of 
administrative capacity and coordination across districts. Gujarat’s infrastructure-led 
and event-based tourism initiatives illustrate the gains from coordinated planning and 
execution across departments,27 while Kerala’s state-led destination management and 
community participation supported an ecologically appropriate and responsible tourism 
model.28 Sikkim’s focus on sustainability and regulated visitor numbers illustrates how 
effective regulation and community involvement can preserve destination quality while 
supporting steady tourism growth.29 In high-footfall cities such as Varanasi, large-scale 
investments in urban infrastructure through schemes like the Kashi development 
programme highlight the role of strengthened municipal capacity in crowd management, 
sanitation, and last-mile connectivity. 30
7.28.	 In recent years, the Central Government has strengthened the tourism 
framework by prioritising experience-based and sustainable destination development. 
Schemes such as Swadesh Darshan 2.0, the Challenge-Based Destination Development 
initiative, and continued investments under PRASHAD have shifted the focus towards 
thematic, visitor-centric tourism. These efforts have been complemented by initiatives 
such as 'Dekho Apna Desh' and 'Incredible India', as well as improved visa facilitation 
and expanded regional air connectivity under UDAN, which have boosted tourism 
demand, particularly for lesser-known Tier 2 and Tier 3 destinations.
7.29.	 Sustaining and broadening this growth will require strengthening state and 
local capacity for event management, infrastructure upkeep, skills development, and 
the adoption of best practices. A tourist-centric approach-emphasising ease of travel, 
accommodation, local mobility, cleanliness, safety, and service quality-along with wider 
use of digital tools and private sector participation, will support higher-value segments. 
For medical tourism to thrive, targeted measures such as direct flight connectivity to 
key source countries, including those in Africa, and priority-based visa facilitation are 
also critical. Indian airports can aspire to become global aviation hubs by promoting 
layovers and enhancing the transit experience for international passengers. Sustained 
global branding and promotion in source destinations will strengthen higher tourism 
demand.
7.30.	 India also has significant untapped potential in niche tourism segments. The 
development of long-distance hiking trails, comparable to the Appalachian or Camino

trails, can leverage India’s ecological diversity, cultural heritage, and existing pilgrimage, 
forest and river corridors. This can support sustainable livelihoods in remote regions 
through community-managed, eco-friendly infrastructure, such as micro-lodges or 
homestays, campsites with standalone green energy sources, clean sanitation facilities, 
GPS-enabled navigation systems, and rescue & evacuation facilities necessary in such 
remote locations. 
7.31.		 Similarly, India’s vast coastline offers scope to unlock the blue economy through 
modern marina infrastructure. Marinas, the purpose-built harbours for recreational 
boats and yachts with moorings, fuel, maintenance, hospitality and water-based 
tourism facilities, are virtually absent in India. This constrains the growth of pleasure 
yachting and small-vessel building, limiting a critical first step towards the broader, 
mass-scale development of shipping infrastructure, a key policy focus of government. 
A national marina development policy that enables private players to run marinas 
under a transparent permit regime could support sailing, diving, and leisure cruising. 
This would help attract high-value tourism and international regatta events such as 
the Swan Cup National Regatta. Being employment-intensive, it could generate more 
employment in coastal regions, along with additional income for fishermen. This could 
also revive uneconomical ports and promote sustainable coastal development.
b.  Information Technology and IT-Enabled Services: Adjusting to a 
New Global Cycle
7.32.	 In FY25, the IT and IT-enabled services (IT-ITeS) sector reinforced India’s 
position as a global technology and innovation hub, supported by continued revenue 
growth, a rising role of Global Capability Centres (GCCs), and deeper engagement in 
higher-value, complex technology activities. Nasscom estimates IT&ITeS industry 
revenues at USD 283 billion in FY25, (including hardware) implying a year-on-year 
growth of 5.1 per cent as against 3.9 per cent in FY24, underscoring resilience amid 
currency depreciation and subdued global tech spending. IT services exports, a key 
stabiliser of the external sector, are estimated to grow by 3.7 per cent in FY25. 
7.33.	 In recent years, a key structural feature underpinning the IT-ITeS sector’s 
performance has been the steady expansion of Global Capability Centres (GCCs) - 
offshore units established by multinational firms to undertake technology development, 
engineering, analytics and business operations for their global activities. As of FY24, 
India hosts over 1,700+ GCCs, employing over 19 lakh professionals, making it the largest 
global hub for captive centres. GCCs account for a significant share of employment 
within the IT sector and have contributed meaningfully to incremental hiring in recent 
years.

7.34.	 Over time, GCCs have evolved from support-oriented functions into integral 
components of multinational firms’ global operations, undertaking core activities 
such as product development, engineering, analytics, cybersecurity operations and AI-
enabled digital functions, thereby strengthening India’s integration into global value 
chains as a resilient source of growth. The diversification of the GCC ecosystem has 
been driven by the growing participation of more specialised and innovation-focused 
mid-market GCCs, comprising mid-sized and emerging multinational firms. In parallel, 
the expansion of GCCs into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities has supported more geographically 
dispersed employment and strengthened linkages with local innovation and startup 
ecosystems.
7.35.	 Driven by surging data consumption, rapid cloud adoption, and the growing use 
of AI, India’s data centre capacity is projected to reach about 8 GW by 2030 from about 
1.4GW as of Q2 of 2025.31 AI data centres are specialised high-performance facilities 
designed to meet the intensive computational needs of artificial intelligence, machine 
learning, and deep learning workloads. Despite generating nearly 20 per cent of the 
world’s data, India hosts only about 3 per cent of global data centres, around 150 out of 
11,000 worldwide, according to Nasscom, highlighting both a large growth opportunity 
and a competitiveness gap. Data centres are also double-edged swords as they are very 
energy-intensive. With emerging hubs such as Malaysia (Johor), Japan, and Vietnam 
intensifying competition, addressing structural constraints such as energy shortages 
will be critical for India to position itself as a global AI data centre hub.
31 	Source: S&P (https://tinyurl.com/4a5rzwe4); Data centers are commonly measured by gigawatts (GW), as power 
consumption has become the primary metric for defining their capacity and scale, especially with the rise of AI 
and high-performance computing.

7.36.	 Another key trend in the IT-ITeS sector is a shift towards higher-value products 
and capability-driven growth. According to Nasscom, Deep Tech companies experienced 
a 78 per cent rise in funding in CY2024. India’s technology startup ecosystem, the world’s 
third largest, now comprises about 32,000-35,000 startups, with over 2,000 added in 
CY25, including over 900 funded start-ups in CY25. Within this, the Generative AI 
segment has expanded rapidly, with active GenAI startups rising more than threefold 
from about 240 in H1 CY2024 to over 890 by H1 CY2025.

7.37.	 Rising digitalisation, cloud adoption, and data-intensive technologies have also 
increased the demand for cybersecurity, including threat detection, risk management, 
compliance, and managed security services. India’s cybersecurity market is estimated 
at about USD 6.0 billion in 2023, growing at about 30 percent, according to Nasscom-
DSCI. India’s strengthening capabilities are also evident in its Tier-1 ranking on the 
International Telecommunication Union’s Global Cybersecurity Index in 2024, with a 
score of 98.49, placing it among the world’s most cyber-resilient countries.

7.38.	 A structural shift, rather than a cyclical disruption, is evident in global demand 
for productivity-enhancing solutions driven by Generative AI, cloud adoption, 
cybersecurity, and data engineering. While India has improved its ranking in 
UNCTAD’s Frontier Technology Readiness Index, from 48th in 2022 to 36th in the 
latest assessment (2024) among 170 economies, weaker outcomes in ICT penetration 
and skills, as reflected in the same index, point to constraints in the wider diffusion 
of frontier technologies across firms and regions. As the IT-ITeS sector creates new 
opportunities for productivity gains and movement up the value chain, it is at an 
inflexion point, with the key challenge lying in timely reskilling and the adaptation of 
firms and the workforce to evolving business models. 
7.39.	 For India, Singapore’s model offers valuable lessons. Since the early 2000s, 
Singapore has implemented successive multi-year Research, Innovation and 
Enterprise (RIE) plans to align public R&D investment, industry participation and 
talent development with evolving economic priorities.32 Key features of Singapore’s 
R&D framework include focused investment in select domains (such as advanced 
manufacturing, digital technologies, biomedical sciences, and sustainability); 
strong industry-research linkages through co-funded programmes and collaborative 
platforms; centralised governance to avoid a fragmented approach; predictable multi-
year funding to enable long-horizon and high-risk innovation investments; and a talent-
centric approach to augment the supply of high-skilled researchers and workforce. 
This approach has delivered measurable outcomes: gross R&D expenditure rose from 
about US$7.1 billion in 2012 to US$12.7 billion in 2022, around 65 per cent of which is 
business-led, alongside a sharp rise in patenting from about 1,722 in 2012 to over 4,107 
by 202233  and consistently strong innovation rankings. India’s ongoing initiatives-such 
as the ANRF & RDI Scheme, mission-based programmes in semiconductors, clean 
energy, and biotechnology, and PLI schemes-already signal a shift towards mission-
driven, industry-linked R&D with the aim of concentrating resources in priority 
domains. 
7.40.	 Looking ahead, the IT-ITeS sector is well-positioned to play a larger role in 
India’s medium-term growth and productivity. Realising this potential will require 
strengthening the foundations for innovation-led, capability-intensive growth through 
a skilled and adaptable workforce, wider diffusion of digital technologies, and a policy 
environment that supports innovation and scaling. Some interventions can be relatively 
straightforward, for instance, recognising data centres and cloud service providers 
as a distinct category, rather than classifying them as “commercial buildings” under

the National Building Code, 2016, which does not account for their specialised design 
needs. Additional measures could include releasing more anonymised public data to 
leverage scalable cloud-based Digital Public Infrastructure while maintaining robust 
security standards; facilitating visas for key professionals; providing tax clarity for data 
hosted by foreign entities in India; enabling energy-intensive data centres to access 
renewable power; and establishing centres of excellence within corporate hubs to 
strengthen research partnerships with academia.
c.  Transport Services: Strengthening connectivity and logistics 
performance
7.41.		 Transport services directly contribute around 4.5 per cent to GVA34, and form 
a foundational component enabling services for a wide range of economic activities, 
including manufacturing, trade, and mobility across the economy. The sub-sector has 
strengthened in recent years, supported by the Government’s sustained emphasis on 
infrastructure development.
Cargo transport services at ports
7.42.	 Port capacity has expanded in recent years through modernisation, digitisation, 
and greater private participation. As a result, cargo handled at Indian ports35 increased 
from about 1052 million tonnes in FY15 to around 1603 million tonnes in FY25. This 
momentum continued into FY26, with port cargo traffic at major ports recording an 
8.2 per cent growth during April-December, reflecting strengthening trade activity 
(Table VII.1). Alongside higher volumes, operational efficiency has also improved, 
with the average turnaround time of container vessels at major ports declining from 
approximately 43 hours in FY15 to nearly 30 hours in FY25.36 Complementing port-
led gains, cargo movement on national waterways increased from approximately 
18.1 million tonnes in FY14 to over 145.5 million tonnes in FY25, reflecting improved 
integration between ports and inland waterways.
Aviation Services for Passenger and Cargo Transport
7.43.	 Aviation services have continued to play a key role in sustaining passenger 
mobility and air cargo flows. In FY25, overall air passenger traffic increased by 9.4 
per cent, reaching 411.8 million passengers, driven by broad-based demand from both 
domestic and international travellers (Table VII.1). However, a softening of momentum 
was observed during April-November 2025, when overall passenger traffic increased 
by 3.5 per cent (YoY), reflecting flight disruptions and short-term demand adjustments

in the domestic passenger segment. During this period, domestic passenger traffic 
moderated to 2.6 per cent, while international passenger traffic recorded a relatively 
strong growth of 7.3 per cent, despite subdued foreign tourist arrivals. 
7.44.	 Similar trends were observed in the air cargo segment. After recording a robust 
growth of 10.5 per cent in FY25, supported by steady trade flows, air cargo growth 
moderated to about 5.0 per cent during April-November 2025. Industry assessments 
suggest that this moderation reflects a combination of factors, including higher 
operating costs, capacity constraints, geopolitical uncertainties affecting international 
routes, and a normalisation of demand after strong growth in the previous year.

Railway freight services
7.45.	 Rail freight services, a 50 per cent cost-effective cargo route compared to road 
transport, continue to play a critical role in supporting the bulk and long-distance 
movement of goods essential for core industrial activity.37 In FY25, freight loading by 
Indian Railways exceeded 1.6 billion tonnes, witnessing a slight expansion over FY24. 
However, it remains 12.5 per cent higher than the average of FY21-FY24, signalling a 
healthy underlying momentum. This momentum has been sustained into FY26, with 
freight loading growing by 3.3 per cent and reaching about 1,215 million tonnes (MT) 
37 	https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2214076&utm

during April-December (Table VII.1). Growth was supported by strong demand from 
core sectors such as coal (601 MT), iron ore (138 MT), cement (109 MT), container 
traffic (71 MT), pig iron and finished steel (56 MT), fertilisers (52 MT), mineral oil 
(38 MT), foodgrains (36 MT), raw materials for steel plants (approximately 23 MT), 
and other goods (91 MT).
7.46.	 Railways’ operational efficiency has also improved, with average daily freight 
loading rising from 4.2 million tonnes in 2024 to about 4.4 million tonnes in 2025. 
This has been supported by capacity augmentation through the commissioning of new 
tracks and the expansion of Dedicated Freight Corridors, which have eased congestion 
and increased movement speeds. Policy measures, including bulk cement terminals, 
rationalised freight rates for containerised cement movement, and wider adoption 
of digital platforms such as the Freight Operation Information System, have further 
strengthened bulk handling and operational efficiency.
d.  Telecommunication: 
Expanding 
Connectivity 
and 
Digital 
Capabilities
7.47.	 Telecommunications services, which contribute directly to about 1.2 per cent 
of India’s GVA, form a foundational backbone of the digital economy, supporting 
productivity and service delivery across sectors through improved access, affordability, 
and usage. Telecom connectivity has expanded steadily over the past decade. Total 
telephone connections rose from about 933 million in 2014 to over 1.2 billion by 
November 2025, with tele-density increasing from 75 per cent to 86.8 per cent, driven 
largely by faster growth in rural areas, indicating improved digital inclusion. Internet 
subscriptions expanded sharply from about 25 crore to 101.8 crore by September 2025, 
alongside rising broadband penetration.38 Affordability improvements are reflected 
in average monthly data consumption per subscriber, which increased from 62 MB 
in 2014 to about 25 GB by mid-2025. This was supported by a steep decline in data 
prices -from around ₹300 per GB in 2014 to ₹8.3 per GB in 202539, along with steady 
improvements in digital and communication infrastructure.
7.48.	 This expansion in connectivity has been underpinned by steady improvements 
in India’s digital and communication infrastructure, combining public R&D with 
programme-based deployment. India has developed end-to-end indigenous 4G and 
5G (NSA) core network technologies, placing it among a small group of countries 
with domestic telecom capabilities, while national programmes have expanded 
network reach and capacity. Alongside this, advances in cyber and telecom security 
have strengthened network reliability, improved disaster-resilient communications,

and supported progress in next-generation secure technologies, including quantum-
secured communication.
e.  Real estate and housing services
7.49.	 The ‘real estate and ownership of dwellings’ sector has contributed about 7 per 
cent to annual GVA, on average, over the past decade, highlighting its importance 
in services-led growth and strong linkages with construction and financial services. 
Over this period, policy reforms, including the implementation of the Real Estate 
(Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), GST, and the Housing for All mission, have 
supported greater formalisation of the sector. Demand-side measures, such as interest 
subvention under PMAY (Urban), the Affordable Housing Fund, lower interest rates, 
and streamlined credit processes, have further strengthened access to housing finance. 
Urban initiatives, such as the Smart Cities Mission and the Urban Infrastructure 
Development Fund (UIDF), have supported housing demand in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.
7.50.	 Backed by these reforms, the sector entered a sustained upcycle from September 
2021, post-COVID, as reflected in improved sales, driven by higher household savings 
channelled towards physical assets (Chart VII.14). The momentum has continued in 
recent quarters, supported by favourable affordability conditions and easing inflation. 
On average, housing volume sales continue to remain higher compared to FY22-FY24 
(Chart VII.15). Housing finance also expanded steadily, with outstanding individual 
housing loans more than tripling from about ₹10 lakh crore as at the end of March 2015 
to over ₹37 lakh crore at end March 202540, raising housing loans from 8.0 per cent to 
over 11 per cent of GDP, indicating a deeper financialisation of housing demand.

f.  Media and entertainment services
7.51.		 The media and entertainment (M&E) sector has become a significant component 
of India’s services economy, spanning audio-visual production, broadcasting, digital 
content, animation and gaming, advertising, and live entertainment. Over the past 
decade, it has undergone a structural shift towards digital and platform-based delivery, 
reshaping revenue models, value chains and employment. Industry estimates place the 
sector’s size at around ₹2.5 trillion in 202441, driven by rising incomes, rapid internet 
penetration and a large domestic market. Digital media emerged as the primary growth 
engine, contributing approximately one-third of the sector's total revenues, while 
also driving demand for content production, post-production, Visual Effects (VFX), 
dubbing, and localisation, all integrated into global distribution networks.
7.52.	 Segment-wise, audio-visual and film services remain central, with India among 
the world’s largest content producers, and revenues are increasingly driven by digital 
distribution. Video subscription revenues are estimated at ₹9,200 crore in 2024. 
Broadcasting and advertising have shifted decisively from linear TV to OTT and mobile 
platforms, with digital advertising growing faster than traditional formats. High-
growth, export-oriented segments, such as animation and VFX, reached a revenue 
size of approximately ₹103 billion in 2024, supported by skilled manpower and cost 
competitiveness. The gaming segment, driven largely by mobile platforms and digital 
payments, expanded rapidly, with industry revenues estimated at around ₹232 billion 
in 2024, supported by a large and growing user base, even as monetisation models 
continue to evolve. Live entertainment also rebounded strongly post-pandemic (See

Box VII.6 on the Orange Economy), crossing ₹100 billion in 2024 and generating 
spillovers to tourism and urban services. Overall, medium-term prospects remain 
strong, bolstered by digital adoption, content diversification, experiential consumption, 
expanding connectivity, and technological advances in AI, immersive media and virtual 
production.
Box VII.6: The Orange Economy - An Emerging Lever for Media, 
Tourism and Urban Services
The “Orange Economy” refers to the part of the economy driven by creativity, culture, 
and intellectual property, comprising activities where value comes primarily from ideas, 
knowledge, artistic expression, and cultural content, rather than from physical goods. 
Of this, the concert economy comprises large-scale live music and entertainment events, 
along with their associated value chains, including ticketing, hospitality, travel, logistics, 
media production, advertising, and local services, extending beyond physical attendance. 
International evidence shows that live concerts are high-multiplier, services-intensive 
activities, generating economic value well beyond ticket sales by supporting tourism, 
employment and urban services. Globally, live music accounts for about one-third of total 
music revenues; in the US, it generated over USD 130 billion and supported more than 
900,000 jobs in 2019.42 In the UK, music tourism alone contributed £6.6 billion (USD 
8.1 billion) in 2022 (about 0.3 per cent of GDP), reflecting strong spillovers to hospitality, 
transport and retail.43 Concerts also serve as short-duration tourism demand amplifiers, 
being labour-intensive and creating jobs across various sectors, including event operations, 
logistics, hospitality, security, and media, particularly for young people and creative 
professionals. According to UNCTAD estimates44, the creative industries contribute between 
0.5 per cent and over 7 per cent of GDP across countries, underscoring the significant 
potential of live entertainment.
In India, the concert economy is nascent but scaling, supported by a young population, 
rising incomes, digital ticketing platforms and improving urban infrastructure. International 
experience underscores that economic gains depend on urban readiness and facilitative 
governance, including streamlined permissions, predictable regulations, efficient crowd 
management, last-mile connectivity and coordination across city authorities and tourism 
bodies. In India, there is a lack of live event venues and restrictions on the foreign payments 
that can be made to artists coming from abroad. Opening up heritage monuments for such 
events and facilitating the visa and foreign exchange permissions for the foreign performers/
artists could be considered in this regard. Considering that anywhere between 10 and 15 
clearances are required, the Ministry of I&B is working on a Single Window Mechanism for 
Live Entertainment Permissions,45 including those needed from state governments. With

appropriate facilitation and integration into tourism and city branding strategies, the concert 
economy can become a meaningful driver of growth for M&E, tourism and allied services.
g.  Commercialising Space and Ocean Services 
7.53.	 India’s space sector has emerged as a fast-growing, technology-intensive and 
increasingly commercial segment of the services economy. Valued at about USD 8.4 
billion (around 2 per cent of the global space market), it is projected to expand to USD 
44 billion over the next decade46, driven by launch services, satellite communications, 
earth observation, navigation and a rapidly growing private ecosystem. Commercial 
launches have been a key export source, with India launching 393 foreign satellites for 
34 countries between 2015 and 2024. This effort has earned nearly USD 143 million 
and EUR 272 million47, reflecting its cost-effective and reliable capabilities amid rising 
global demand for small satellites.
7.54.	 Commercialisation has been strengthened through NewSpace India Limited 
(NSIL)48, whose revenues rose from ₹322 crore in FY20 to ₹2,940 crore in FY23, with 
further expansion projected in FY25 to ₹3246.1 crore.49 Profitability has also improved 
steadily, driven by demand-driven missions, satellite capacity leasing, and end-to-end 
commercial project execution, including dedicated launch services and the deployment 
of communication satellites. Satellite-enabled services are expanding rapidly, with 
India’s satellite data services market valued at USD 495 million in 202450, driven by 
applications in defence, climate services, logistics and urban planning. At the same 
time, India’s private “NewSpace” ecosystem has scaled across manufacturing, launch 
vehicles, data analytics and downstream services, attracting over ₹1,000 crore in 
private funding in FY23.51 Commercial leasing of transponder capacity, global sale of 
Earth observation imagery, and growing adoption of NavIC52 in navigation and mobility 
services are expanding downstream service revenues. Policy initiatives such as the 
Indian Space Policy (2023), the operationalisation of IN-SPACe, and liberalised FDI 
norms have lowered entry barriers and enabled a transition towards a mixed public-
private services model. This has enabled the space sector to evolve into a high-value, 
export-oriented and innovation-driven services segment.

7.55.	 Just as space, ocean technology and ocean sciences can be scaled through public-
private partnerships. Developing heterogeneous Earth-system data products and 
services across the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere and geosphere can fundamentally 
transform the economics of Earth-system science and applications.
CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD
7.56.	 The trajectory of India’s services sector over the past year underscores its 
significance to the nation’s economic growth, resilience, and structural transformation. 
Amidst global volatility and shifting geopolitical alignments, the sector has not only 
maintained robust momentum in output, employment, and exports but has also 
demonstrated adaptability through diversification into high-value, technology-driven, 
and experience-led segments. 
7.57.	 This performance has been underpinned by a series of far-reaching reform 
measures and policy initiatives that have systematically addressed legacy bottlenecks 
and positioned the sector for sustained, inclusive growth. Improvements in digital and 
physical infrastructure, connectivity, logistics and urban services have broadened the 
domestic base of services-led activity. The expansion of digitally delivered, knowledge-
intensive and experience-based services has strengthened India’s underlying 
comparative advantages. The government’s proactive approach to trade policy, evident 
in the negotiation of comprehensive free trade agreements and economic partnerships, 
has facilitated greater market access, professional mobility, and regulatory cooperation, 
thereby enhancing the global competitiveness of Indian services. In parallel, targeted 
interventions in skill development, urban infrastructure, and innovation ecosystems 
have sought to bridge regional and sectoral disparities, foster entrepreneurship, and 
align workforce capabilities with evolving market needs.
7.58.	 While technologies are enhancing productivity and enabling new service models, 
the pace of change is outpacing workforce and firm-level adaptation. As a result, many 
economies face widening skills gaps, with rising demand for specialised capabilities in 
areas such as data analytics, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI, alongside greater 
automation of routine service tasks. Tighter immigration regimes in several advanced 
economies and intensifying global competition for skilled talent are further influencing 
the cross-border delivery of services. Against this global backdrop, going forward, 
sustaining India’s position in the global services market will depend on productivity 
gains, continued innovation, ongoing investment in skills aligned with emerging 
technologies, and further simplification of regulatory processes. How effectively the 
sector responds to these factors will shape its contribution to India’s growth trajectory 
in the years ahead.

Services: From Stability to New Frontiers
291
291
7.59.	 The chapter also highlights key areas for improvement across major services 
segments. For IT and IT-enabled services, the sector’s future hinges on timely reskilling, 
the wider diffusion of digital technologies, and the creation of a supportive policy 
environment for innovation and scaling. Key reforms include recognising the unique 
requirements of data centres, such as access to green energy, facilitating visas for 
skilled professionals, providing tax clarity for digital services, and the need to promote 
mission-driven, industry-linked research, as well as predictable funding and strong 
public-private collaboration. Tourism requires the creation of niche segments, such as 
long-distance hiking trails, and a national marina development policy to unlock the 
blue economy. Streamlining permissions for live events, opening up heritage venues, 
and facilitating foreign artist participation will help realise the potential of the concert 
and orange economies. Space and ocean services are poised for rapid expansion through 
commercialisation and public-private partnerships. Collectively, these efforts can 
enable the services sector to remain competitive, employment-intensive and resilient, 
while supporting sustained and inclusive economic growth.
