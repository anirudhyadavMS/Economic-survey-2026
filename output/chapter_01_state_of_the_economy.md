STATE OF THE ECONOMY: 
PUSHING THE GROWTH 
FRONTIER
The global economic environment remains uncertain, shaped by geopolitical 
tensions, trade disruptions, and divergent growth and inflation outcomes 
across major economies. While global activity has shown resilience in the near 
term, underlying vulnerabilities persist, including elevated fiscal pressures, 
fragmented supply chains, and an increased reliance on economic policy 
instruments for strategic purposes.
Against this backdrop, the Indian economy has maintained strong growth 
momentum in FY26. The First Advance Estimates place real GDP growth at 7.4 
per cent, with growth largely driven by domestic demand. Private consumption 
and capital formation continue to support expansion, while services remain the 
key contributor on the supply side. Manufacturing activity has strengthened, 
and agriculture has provided stability, notwithstanding structural constraints.
The chapter analyses demand and supply-side developments during the first 
half of FY26, supported by high-frequency indicators for the third quarter. It 
highlights the role of consumption and investment in sustaining growth, even 
as external demand provides incremental support amid challenging global 
conditions. To supplement official estimates, the chapter also uses high-frequency 
indicators and an in-house nowcasting framework to assess near-term growth 
trends.
The chapter reviews key macroeconomic fundamentals, including inflation, 
financial sector conditions, fiscal developments, external sector performance, 
and labour market trends. Inflation has moderated, financial sector balance 
sheets remain healthy, and fiscal policy continues to strike a balance between 
supporting growth and consolidation. The external sector remains manageable, 
supported by services exports and adequate foreign exchange reserves.
Looking ahead, while global uncertainties remain elevated, domestic 
growth drivers are expected to continue supporting economic activity. With 
macroeconomic stability in place and ongoing reform efforts, the economy 
appears well-positioned to sustain growth in the near term. The outlook 
for FY27 is shaped by these domestic strengths, alongside evolving external 
conditions. The chapter concludes that India’s medium-term growth potential 
has strengthened to 7 per cent, positioning the economy on a path of steady 
expansion amid global uncertainty.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH – FRAGILE AND DIVERGING
1.1.	 Since the last version of the Economic Survey was published, the global economy has 
been subjected to multiple upheavals. The most disruptive amongst these disturbances 
was the imposition of tariffs by the USA on imports from its trade partners. The long 
promised reciprocal tariffs, announced in April 2025, initially sparked concerns about 
lower growth and higher inflation in the global economy which have proven to be 
transient in the short run. This was due to multiple reasons. Trade agreements between 
the US and certain trading partners have considerably lowered the US’s effective tariff 
rate. According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO), October 2025, US 
households and businesses increased their spending ahead of expected tariff hikes. In 
some instances, delays in tariff implementation allowed businesses to postpone raising 
prices and frontload their exports. As a result, global economic activity has remained 
relatively stable in the short term. This is reflected in the IMF’s projections of growth and 
inflation for advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market and developing economies 
(EMDEs) made at various points in time between January 2025 and January 2026 (Table 
I.1). Growth in EMDEs for the year 2025 is eventually higher than the levels projected in 
April 2025, while that in AEs is projected to be better than initially feared, primarily 
driven by strong growth in the US. For the year 2025, inflation in AEs is expected to have 
remained stubbornly higher by 40 basis points compared to initial projections, while that 
in EMDEs is expected to have declined further (Table I.1). 
1.2.	 These aggregated statistics, however, hide emerging frailties in economic activity

within and across countries. Growth in the US has remained strong, primarily driven 
by investment in artificial intelligence (AI). Total IT investment, which also includes 
spending by businesses on equipment and software to facilitate AI use, has accounted for 
nearly half of GDP growth in recent quarters, helping to mitigate the negative effects of 
trade tariffs on growth.1 This strong growth has been accompanied by inflation remaining 
stubbornly above the 2 per cent target and a rising unemployment rate. While inflation 
in Europe is broadly trending towards the European Central Bank’s target, growth in the 
region’s economies has been mixed. Forecasts by the European Commission2 indicate that 
growth rates in Germany, Italy, and France are expected to remain moderate, while Spain 
is anticipated to outperform. In Asia, the Chinese economy continues to face deflationary 
pressures amid headwinds stemming from the crisis in its property sector, indicating 
tepid domestic demand, even as Chinese merchandise exports remain a key driver of its 
growth. Growth in the Japanese economy remains moderate, while inflation continues to 
exceed the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) target of 2 per cent. 
1.3.	 Globally, the shift from aggressive monetary policy tightening to a neutral or 
accommodative stance is still underway. However, the aforementioned variance in 
growth-inflation dynamics has led to divergent trajectories of central bank policy rates 
across these economies (Charts I.1 and I.2). This has implications for capital flows as 
fund houses trot the globe in search of higher yields. 
1.4.	 Amidst ongoing weaknesses in growth and inflation, fiscal policies in major 
economies stay expansionary. While the projected primary deficits for 2025 are

generally smaller than the record deficits of 2020 and 2021, when substantial fiscal 
stimulus was used to address the pandemic impact, they are still significantly higher 
than pre-pandemic levels, except in Brazil and India (Chart I.3). Long-term borrowing 
costs for the world’s biggest economies have stayed elevated as investors question the 
ability of governments to cover massive budget deficits. These pressures are showing 
in elevated bond yields across major AEs, particularly in the ultra-long tenure segment 
(Chart I.4). Earlier in May 2025, 30-year bond yields reached a peak of 5.15 per cent in 
the US, approaching levels last seen in 2007. Those in Japan exceeded the highest on 
record in data since 1999, with auctions in both countries drawing tepid demand. Long-
dated bonds in the UK, Germany and Australia also faced selling pressure.3
1.5.	 Global economic uncertainty remains elevated compared to historical trends (Chart 
I.5), primarily on account of fragmentation in geopolitical relationships and lower 
visibility on policy continuity. This, coupled with the aforementioned macroeconomic 
developments, has led to a deterioration in global foreign direct investment (FDI) 
flows. As per the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) 
World Investment Report 20254, FDI flows in 2024, barring those in certain conduit 
economies, declined by 11 per cent YoY (Chart I.6).  Capital flows are also increasingly 
being shaped by the surge in demand across the AI supply chain in a few countries. 
While FDI flows in most developed countries fell, they rose by 19.7 per cent in the US.

semiconductor manufacturing, with three of them located in the United States.5 Data 
centre development is also expanding rapidly, driven by growing digital demand and 
strategic industrial policies.  
1.6.	 The global economy has entered a phase in which geopolitical considerations 
exert a much stronger influence than they did in the 2010s. Rapidly evolving country 
alignments and supply chains, as well as technological developments, necessitate 
supplementing traditional economic assessments with a geopolitical perspective. 
In this context, Box I.1 elaborates on the resurgence of economic statecraft and the 
implications for our development strategy.
Over the past few years, ‘Economic Statecraft’, broadly defined as the deliberate use of 
economic means to achieve strategic ends, has witnessed a rapid resurgence. This shift 
reflects rising geopolitical competition, concerns over technological dominance and 
vulnerabilities exposed in traditional global value chains. 
How does economic policy differ from economic statecraft? Economic policy employs 
traditional instruments, including fiscal, monetary, and trade tools, to achieve economic 
objectives such as reducing deficits, controlling inflation, and promoting economic growth. 
Economic statecraft goes a step further by employing economic tools to achieve foreign 
policy or national security objectives, such as compelling a country to stop hostilities with a 
third party or to liberalise its markets.

Economic statecraft is not new. Historical examples include the Megarian Decree imposed 
by Athens in ancient Greece6 and the Roman Empire’s grain provisioning system (Cura 
Annonae7). Kautilya’s Arthashastra is recognised as a systematic treatise on statecraft that 
integrates economic governance with political and strategic imperatives. 
In the modern world, recent experience illustrates that economic interdependence, once 
viewed as a source of mutual stability, is now increasingly perceived as a channel of 
vulnerability. Disruptions during the pandemic, the weaponisation of energy and finance 
during geopolitical conflicts, and the growing use of export controls in advanced-technology 
sectors have underscored the limits of efficiency-driven global integration. Advanced and 
emerging economies alike are therefore re-evaluating their exposure to concentrated supply 
chains, critical raw materials, and key technologies, often under the pretext of security. 
The drivers behind the resurgence of economic statecraft include, but are not limited to, the 
following:
•	
Across regions, the resurgence of ultra-nationalism, rooted in claims of cultural 
superiority and an anti-immigrant stance, is increasingly shaping political and policy 
choices. This shift is narrowing the space for multilateral cooperation and rule-based 
trading, while hardening domestic borders and constraining labour mobility. Overall, 
this has reoriented economic strategies toward inward-looking priorities. 
•	
A growing number of nations are becoming increasingly sceptical of free trade and 
multilateral institutions, which are believed to have led to large and concentrated 
global trade imbalances. In geology, the Earth’s crust remains stable because creation 
and destruction proceed in balance: new crust is continuously born at the Mid-Atlantic 
Ridge, while old crust is absorbed at subduction zones around the Pacific. This geological 
fact offers a powerful metaphor for the global economic order, where stability likewise 
depends on a steady equilibrium between producers who generate surpluses and 
consumers who absorb them. When large surplus and deficit nations diverge in the pace 
of creation and absorption, the resulting imbalances generate stress that fractures the 
global economic landscape.  
•	
The lack of updated global norms to govern competition, investment, and subsidies 
across different development models, which led to the build-up of imbalances and
6 	 The Megarian Decree was an economic sanction imposed by Athens on the city-state of Megara around 432 
BCE, just before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War. Under the decree, Megarian merchants were barred 
from markets and ports controlled by the Athenian Empire, effectively cutting the city off from regional trade 
and severely damaging its economy. Although Athens justified the measure on religious and legal grounds (that 
Megarians were cultivating sacred land belonging to Demeter and were harbouring runaway slaves), it was 
widely seen as a strategic attempt to assert dominance and punish Megara, an ally of Sparta. Sparta demanded 
the repeal of the decree, and Athens’ refusal significantly escalated tensions, contributing to the onset of the war. 
The episode is often cited as one of the earliest examples of economic sanctions being used as a tool of statecraft, 
highlighting how trade restrictions can precipitate major geopolitical conflicts.
7 	 It involved the procurement, storage, and distribution of grain, largely sourced from provinces such as Egypt and 
North Africa, which were then under Roman control, and later included free or subsidised grain distributions to 
Roman citizens. Administered by state officials and backed by imperial authority, the Cura Annonae was both an 
economic and political instrument, aimed at preventing famine, controlling food prices, and maintaining social 
stability. It is often regarded as one of the earliest examples of large-scale public welfare and state intervention in 
markets.

strategic distrust, is fostering a more fragmented and polarised global order, 
accompanied by a weakening, both institutional and financial, of traditional standard-
setting international bodies.
•	
Consequently, geopolitical tensions have intensified. Armed conflict has flared up in 
Eastern Europe and Western Asia after decades of relative peace.  Even traditionally 
pacifist nations like Japan have upped their defence spending to 2 per cent of their GDP. 
•	
Strategic competition is increasingly fuelling trade wars, while nations vie for access to 
critical minerals and technological resources in a manner reminiscent of a new colonial 
scramble.
•	
Given this and in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic, companies are looking to manage 
their supply chains in a manner that reduces geopolitical risk in order to minimise the 
chances of disruptions and bottlenecks. Governments are engaging in this process by 
incentivising companies to develop local supply chains in strategic sectors and to adopt 
friend-shoring and near-shoring (See Chart IV.1 in Chapter IV). 
•	
Countries are increasingly focusing on emerging strategic industries such as renewable 
energy, electric vehicles, critical minerals, semiconductors, and AI, which are viewed 
as critical for economic growth, national security and supremacy, and in the process, 
advancing state support, including as equity investments, into bigger industrial players, 
who otherwise would not have been in the perimeter for state benefits.   
Economic statecraft can manifest as either ‘carrots’ or ‘sticks’, depending on the objective 
and the parties involved. Tools of economic statecraft can be broadly categorised into the 
domains of trade, capital and other tools. Some recent examples of tools deployed include:
•	
US’ export controls on critical technologies: The United States has imposed 
extensive export controls on advanced semiconductors and associated manufacturing 
equipment to constrain China’s access to next-generation AI and chip technologies, 
expanding coverage based on end-use and foreign-direct product rules.8 These measures 
aim to hinder strategic military and civilian capabilities in rival states.
•	
Dual-use and critical mineral export restrictions: China has tightened export 
licensing and controls on key rare earth elements and permanent magnet materials 
essential for defence, electronics, and energy transitions. In early 2026, China banned 
certain dual-use item exports to Japan, including materials crucial to the automotive 
and technology sectors, in response to diplomatic tensions.9
•	
Sanctions and blacklists: Chinese authorities have added foreign defence and 
technology firms to “Unreliable Entities Lists,” restricting trade and investment in 
response to perceived national security threats, while Western nations have used 
sanctions against Russian entities to constrict war-related supply chains.
8 	 Foreign-Direct Product Rules are provisions in U.S. export control law that allow the US to regulate certain 
goods made outside the US if those goods are produced using U.S.-origin technology, software, or manufacturing 
equipment and are destined for a restricted end-user (for example, a sanctioned firm or country)

Tariffs:  Rolled out in 2023 and fully effective from 2026, the EU Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) puts tariffs on imports like steel and cement based on 
embedded emissions, targeting high-pollution exporters (e.g., China, India) as classified 
under EU methodology, to protect European industry alongside achieving climate goals.
•	
Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy is inherently a form of statecraft: it primarily hinges on the 
allocation of expenditures and the extent to which the fiscal deficit can be expanded and 
financed during a geopolitical crisis. Currently, for instance, European economies face 
the challenge of balancing demands for increased defence spending to ensure external 
stability, augmented social spending to sustain internal stability, enhanced green 
initiatives to promote climate stability, and adherence to strict fiscal deficit or public 
debt-to-GDP ratio targets to retain economic stability. China utilises its fiscal power to 
construct infrastructure in other countries through its Belt and Road Initiative, aiming 
to enhance its trade and economic dominance. 
Against this backdrop, India’s reforms and economic performance over the previous decade 
have helped it stay relevant and resilient, capable of withstanding and adapting to external 
economic pressures and statecraft without disproportionate disruption. We must now move 
a step further and focus on deliberately cultivating strategic indispensability. Strategic 
indispensability arises when an economy offers goods, services, or roles that are sufficiently 
critical to global value chains that partners cannot easily substitute, thereby reducing the 
effectiveness of coercive measures. As a large and rapidly growing economy, India possesses 
scale, diversity, and capabilities that can anchor it firmly within global economic networks. 
By strengthening these domestic capabilities, maintaining macroeconomic stability, and 
actively shaping rules and standards in emerging areas such as digital public infrastructure, 
India can ensure that integration works as a source of influence and insurance, rather 
than vulnerability. In an era where economic instruments are increasingly used as tools of 
statecraft, building such indispensability is central to safeguarding growth, policy space, 
and long-term economic sovereignty. This mechanics are detailed in Chapter 16 (Part-I) and 
(Part-II) of this survey. 
1.7.	 Against this global backdrop, this chapter reviews the performance of the Indian 
economy as reflected in the First Advance Estimates for FY26. It analyses the demand 
and supply side drivers of growth during the first half of FY26, supplemented by an 
assessment of high-frequency indicators for the third quarter. The chapter then 
examines key macroeconomic fundamentals, including trends in inflation, financial 
sector conditions, fiscal policy, external stability, and labour market developments. It 
concludes with an assessment of the near-term outlook for the economy as it heads into 
FY27.

strong growth path, as reflected in the First Advance Estimates (FAE) for FY26 released 
by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). These estimates 
place the real GDP growth rate at 7.4 per cent and the GVA growth rate at 7.3 per 
cent, surpassing earlier projections by various agencies and our own estimates in the 
Economic Survey of 2024-25, and reaffirming India's status as the fastest-growing 
major economy for the fourth consecutive year. On the demand side, domestic demand 
continues to anchor growth, supported by a strengthening momentum in capital 
formation. On the supply side, manufacturing activity has gained traction, and services 
continue to drive overall expansion, led by steady performance in trade, transport, and 
financial and professional services. (see Table I.2a). The following sub-section examines 
the sectoral composition and drivers of growth in H1 and the implied growth in H2 of 
FY26.

to the FAE, the share of final private consumption expenditure (PFCE) in GDP rose to 
61.5 per cent in FY26, the highest level since FY12. This is corroborated by the strong 
performance during the first half of the year, with PFCE growing by 7.5 per cent in H1 
of FY26, and its share in GDP rising to 61.4 per cent. This is the fastest growth rate 
since the first half of FY23 and remains higher than the pre-COVID trend of 6.9 per 
cent10 (Chart I.7). This strength in consumption reflects a supportive macroeconomic 
environment, characterised by low inflation, stable employment conditions, and rising 
real purchasing power. Moreover, steady rural consumption, bolstered by strong 
agricultural performance, and the gradual improvement in urban consumption, aided 
by the rationalisation of direct and indirect taxes, reaffirm that the momentum in 
consumption demand is broad-based.

1.10.		 It may be noted that implicit H2 estimates derived from the FAE indicate a slight 
moderation in consumption growth. FAE, however, are based on an extrapolation 
of FY25 consumption levels using data available up to November and are therefore 
subject to revision as additional information becomes available. Subsequent estimates, 
incorporating full-year data, will provide a more complete assessment of private 
consumption performance during FY26, including the impact of recent tax reforms. 
Currently, the strong consumption growth observed in H1, along with supportive high-
frequency indicators during Q3 of FY26, suggests that private consumption is likely to 
remain resilient throughout the year.
1.11.	The key high-frequency indicators for the third quarter of FY26, including 
automobile and tractor sales, as well as air passenger traffic, signal the continuation of 
the robust demand conditions (Table I.3). Furthermore, in the November 2025 round 
of the NABARD Rural Economic Conditions and Sentiments Survey11 79.2 per cent of 
rural households reported increased consumption during the last year, with the share 
of monthly income spent on consumption rising to about 67 per cent, the highest since 
the survey’s inception. This buoyancy in consumption demand can be attributed to 
the positive impact of GST rate rationalisation and softer inflation, improving the real 
purchasing power of rural non-farm income.

1.12.		 Along with consumption, investment has continued to anchor growth in FY26, 
with the share of gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) estimated at 30.0 per cent. 
Investment activity strengthened in the first half of the year, with, GFCF expanding 
by 7.6 per cent, exceeding the pace recorded in the corresponding period last year and 
remaining above the pre-pandemic average of 7.1 per cent (Chart I.9). This momentum 
was buoyed by sustained public capital expenditure12 and a revival in private investment 
activity as evident from corporate announcements.13 Reflecting this strength, the share 
of GFCF in GDP remained steady at 30.5 per cent in H1 of FY26, well above the pre-
pandemic average of 28.6 per cent (Chart I.10). Together, these developments indicate 
a strengthening of the investment cycle, supporting growth. 
12 	During the current fiscal year, capex recorded a strong rebound, rising by 28 per cent YoY during April-November 2025.
13 	As per CMIE database, private corporate investment announcements totalled ₹ 14.6 lakh crore in H1 of FY26 Vs 
₹ 7.9 lakh crore in H1 of FY25 and the previous decadal peak of ₹ 11.4 lakh crore in H1 of FY24.

1.13.		 The implicit H2 estimate of GFCF for FY2614 indicates a firming of the investment 
cycle, likely driven by continued growth in non-food bank credit, coupled with capacity 
utilisation remaining above its long-term average. High-frequency indicators for 
the third quarter also suggest healthy investment activity. In particular, the Index of 
Industrial Production (IIP) shows sustained strength in capital goods, while imports of 
capital goods continue to record strong growth. (Table I.4). 
Capital goods imports are defined as the aggregate of imports of electric machinery and equipment; base metals 
excluding iron and steel; industrial machinery, including machinery for dairy and allied uses; machine tools; other 
construction machinery; project goods; and transport equipment.
1.14.		 While domestic drivers remained the primary source of growth in FY26, external 
demand15, with a share of 21.6 per cent of GDP, also supported growth.  In the first half of 
FY26, exports of goods and services grew by 5.9 per cent, exceeding the growth seen in the 
same period last year, and remaining above the pre-pandemic average, supported by trade 
diversification (Chart I.11). Services exports have continued to provide a stable anchor 
for growth, partially offsetting the greater volatility in goods exports, amid tariff related 
uncertainties. The broader external sector dynamics are examined in detail in Chapter 4.

conditions. Crop-sector growth, which accounts for more than half of agricultural 
GVA, has been marked by significant year-to-year variability and has not exhibited a 
sustained upward trend, reflecting limited productivity gains over time (See Chapter 
16 	Non-petroleum & Non-Gems & Jewellery exports

6 for details). By contrast, allied activities, particularly livestock and fisheries, have 
grown at relatively stable rates of around 5-6 per cent (Chart I.14). As their share in 
agricultural GVA has increased, aggregate agricultural growth has increasingly reflected 
a weighted outcome of volatile crop performance and a relatively stable expansion in 
allied sectors. 
1.18.		 Rabi sowing has been progressing well, aided by replenished reservoir levels, 
adequate soil moisture, and sufficient availability of inputs. As of 16 January 2026, 
areas sown under major crops, wheat and gram, are respectively 1.9 per cent and 5.1 
per cent higher than the corresponding period last year. Agricultural supply prospects, 
therefore, remain supportive. This is expected to strengthen farm incomes and sustain 
rural demand, enabling agriculture to provide a steady contribution to overall growth 
momentum in the second half of FY26. 
1.19.		 Regarding the industry, a concern is often raised about its declining share in 
GVA. The compression in manufacturing’s GVA share stems from relative price effects 
rather than reflecting a decline in manufacturing activities (See section ‘GDP Deflators: 
Manufacturing’s Reversal in Terms of Trade’ in Chapter V) and higher intermediate 
consumption, which reduces net value added relative to sectors with greater pricing 
power, particularly services. In real (constant) price terms, manufacturing’s share has 
remained steady at around 17-18 per cent (Chart I.16). Manufacturing’s gross value 
of output (GVO) has remained broadly stable at around 38 per cent, comparable to 
services, indicating that output has been sustained. Moreover, in FY26, the industrial 
sector is expected to gain momentum, growing at 6.2 per cent, up from 5.9 per cent in 
FY25. 

Economic Survey 2025-26

1.20.	 This assessment is supported by developments in the first half of FY26. The 
sector recorded growth of 7.0 per cent in the first half of FY26, exceeding the growth 
of 6.1 per cent in H1 of FY25 and the pre-COVID trend of 5.2 per cent (Chart I.17). 
Manufacturing was the primary driver, expanding by 8.4 per cent, reflecting resilient 
demand conditions and improved utilisation of existing capacities. Capacity utilisation 
in manufacturing remained above its long-run average during this period.18 Growth in 
electricity, gas, water supply and other utilities was relatively modest at 2.4 per cent, 
lower than the pre-pandemic trend. The mining sector contracted by 1.8 per cent, partly 
due to disruptions caused by excessive rainfall.
1.21.		 Despite weather-related disruptions, construction activity recorded a 7.4 per 
cent growth, lower than in H1 of FY25 but underpinned by sustained public capital 
expenditure and ongoing momentum in infrastructure projects (See Chapter 9 for 
details). Overall, industrial growth remained broad-based, with most segments 
performing above their pre-pandemic trends.
1.22.	 The high-frequency indicators for Q3 of FY26, including the PMI manufacturing, 
IIP manufacturing, and e-way bill generation, signal a strengthening of manufacturing 
activity underpinned by robust demand (Table I.5). Construction indicators, such as 
steel consumption and cement production, have witnessed a steady growth. Looking 
ahead, momentum in industrial activity is expected to remain buoyant, boosted by the 
rationalisation of GST and a favourable demand outlook.

Services Sector performance 
1.23.	 Services, true to its label as the stabilising component of the GVA, is estimated to 
have grown by 9.1 per cent in FY26, up from 7.2 per cent in FY25, indicating a further 
acceleration in services-led expansion.
1.24.	 GVA in services grew by 9.3 per cent in H1 of FY26, exceeding the 7.0 per cent 
growth recorded in H1 of FY25 and the pre-pandemic average of 7.9 per cent (Chart 
I.18). This momentum gained further traction in H1 FY26, with its share in GDP rising 
to 53.6 per cent, surpassing the levels in H1 FY25 and the pre-pandemic period.

nowcasting exercise are presented in Box I.2.
The Covid-19 pandemic necessitated multiple lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus 
in India. While they contributed to saving lives, the lockdowns disrupted economic activity. 
Even as multiple high-frequency indicators helped gauge sectoral performance, it was 
imperative to form an internal estimate of the direction of economic activity and growth to 
guide policymaking. This became all the more important as official estimates of quarterly GDP 
growth are released two months after the end of the quarter. It was against this backdrop that 
the economic division developed and refined a GDP Nowcasting model for internal use.
Nowcasting refers to the prediction of the present, the very near future and the very recent 
past, and that makes it more effective in shorter horizon forecasting (Banbura, Gianonne &

State of the Economy

19
Reichlin, 2010).19 The basic principle of nowcasting is the exploitation of the information 
which is published early and possibly at higher frequencies than the target variable of 
interest in order to obtain an ‘early estimate’ before the official figure becomes available. 
For instance, multiple high-frequency indicators (HFIs) published at monthly frequencies 
can be used to estimate GDP, which is published quarterly. 
Data 
Amongst the multiple HFIs, 17 indicators with strong correlation with quarterly GDP 
growth are chosen. These are the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), automobile sales, 
non-oil exports, non-oil non-gold imports, PMI manufacturing, PMI Services, electricity 
consumption, tractor sales, air passenger traffic, number of aircraft movements, rail freight 
traffic, port cargo traffic, cement production, steel production, central government gross tax 
revenues, and coal production. The dataset spans January 2006 through the most recent

The underlying model employed is a Dynamic Factor Model (DFM) described in Stock and 
Watson (1989).20 The DFM is a statistical model used to capture the shared dynamics of 
multiple time series by representing them as a function of a few unobserved (latent) factors. 
These factors summarise the co-movement among the observed variables while isolating 
idiosyncratic noise. The model can be expressed in a state-space framework comprising 
an observation equation and a state equation. The observation equation links the observed 
variables  Yt (an n × 1 vector) to the latent factors Ft (a k × 1 vector) as follows:
Yt = ΛFt + εt
where Λ is the n × k matrix of factor loadings, and εt is the n × 1 vector of idiosyncratic 
errors assumed to be uncorrelated across series and over time. The state equation models 
the evolution of the latent factors Ft:
Ft = ΦFt–1 + vt
where Φ is the k × k  transition matrix, and vt is the k × 1 vector of factor disturbances 
typically assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. 
In this case, Yt is the vector of standardised YoY growth of the HFIs.21 The number of factors 
to be extracted is determined by the variance explained by each additional factor. This is

visualised in a “scree plot”.22 The factors which explain the maximum variance in the 
movement of these transformed HFIs are used for estimating DFM here. Once the monthly 
factor is extracted, it is then resampled to a quarterly frequency, taking the mean of the 
monthly factor values within each quarter.
22 Nowcasting models often rely on DFMs to extract a small number of latent factors that capture the common 
movement across many indicators. The scree plot helps identify the number of factors that explain most of the 
variation, thereby ensuring parsimony in the model by avoiding overfitting through discarding noise-driven 
components. A sharp drop in values indicates the point beyond which additional factors add little explanatory 
power.

This quarterly factor is then used as an exogenous variable in modelling GDP growth 
as an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) 
process.23 A dummy variable is also included to account for periods of extreme 
growth. The analysis obtained an in-sample root mean squared error (RMSE) of 
1.6 and an out-of-sample RMSE of 0.87. The portmanteau test confirms that the 
residuals emerging from the ARIMAX model are white noise. Based on data until 
December 2025, the nowcast of real GDP growth for Q3 FY26 stands at 7 per cent.
1.28		 The increasing use of high-frequency indicators and analytical tools such 
as nowcasting underscores the importance of timely, credible and granular data 
for macroeconomic assessment and policymaking. In this context, ongoing efforts 
to strengthen India’s National Statistical System covering data generation, survey 
modernisation, macroeconomic rebasing and digital dissemination assume particular 
relevance. These initiatives are discussed in Box I.3.
Sound public policy rests on timely, credible and granular data. Recognising this, the 
government has undertaken a comprehensive strengthening of the National Statistical 
System, spanning new data generation, survey modernisation, macroeconomic rebasing, 
digital dissemination and data harmonisation. Together, these efforts aim to improve 
evidence-based decision-making in a rapidly changing economy.
Expanding the data frontier through new surveys
To address long-standing data gaps, several major surveys are being introduced or relaunched.
The Annual Survey of Incorporated Service Sector Enterprises (ASISSE), expected to 
commence from April 2026, will for the first time provide a systematic coverage of the 
incorporated services sector. This complements the existing Annual Survey of Unincorporated 
Sector Enterprises (ASUSE), which regularly covers the unincorporated segment of the 
services sector.
The All India Debt and Investment Survey (AIDIS) 2026–27, scheduled to be conducted 
from July 2026 to June 2027, will provide comprehensive information on household 
asset ownership and indebtedness across rural and urban areas. The survey will aid in 
understanding credit markets and assessing inequality in asset distribution. Alongside this, 
the Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) on Rural Agricultural Households 2026–27 will 
offer a holistic picture of farm households, covering incomes, production, indebtedness, 
technology use and access to government schemes.
To fill a critical information gap, a dedicated Household Income Survey is planned tentatively 
in 2026. As regular surveys on household income have not been conducted in India, a Technical

Expert Group is providing guidance on concepts, definitions, methodology and survey 
instruments, while incorporating international best practices.
More frequent and granular statistics
The statistical system is moving decisively towards higher-frequency and sub-state data. The 
Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) is now released quarterly, 
while the sampling design of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) has been revised to 
generate monthly and quarterly estimates. Broader coverage, through larger sample sizes 
and improved sample designs, has been introduced to enable district-level estimates for 
both PLFS and ASUSE by 2026.
The Forward-looking CAPEX Survey (first conducted in October 2024) provides valuable 
policy insights into expected investments by enterprises over two consecutive financial 
years. To meet immediate policy requirements, MoSPI has also conducted short-duration 
annual surveys such as the comprehensive modular surveys on telecom and education in 
2025.
Modernising surveys and strengthening state statistical systems 
MoSPI has undertaken major survey system reforms and survey modernisation initiatives 
aimed at increasing both the frequency and diversity of surveys. Survey operations have 
been transformed through digitalisation. Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI), 
integrated with the cloud-based eSIGMA platform, enables real-time validation, monitoring, 
geotagging and faster data processing. As a result, survey reports are now released within 45 
to 90 days, while monthly results are made available within 15 days.
In parallel, the revamping of the support for statistical strengthening scheme provides 
technical and financial assistance to states and union territories for strengthening state 
statistical systems and improving coordination across the federal statistical framework.
Rebasing macroeconomic indicators for a changing economy
A major milestone is the rebasing of National accounts to 2022-23, scheduled for release 
on 27 February 2026. The new series incorporates the generation of key data sources for 
benchmark revisions through surveys and studies, methodological improvements, wider 
use of administrative data, and better coverage of the informal sector through regular use of 
updated survey data.
Some of the major changes contemplated in the new GDP series include:
•	
Segregation of activities of multi-activity enterprises
•	
Use of GST data for regional allocation in the private corporate sector
•	
Increased dynamism in measuring the household sector through survey results
•	
Improved estimation of private final consumption expenditure using administrative 
data sources such as e-Vaahan
•	
Use of single extrapolation and double deflation, wherever feasible, with deflators 
applied at more disaggregated levels
•	
Revision in the methodology of quarterly estimates through improved benchmarking 
and alignment of indicators, methodology and deflators with annual accounts

•	
Strengthening of informal sector estimates through the combined use of ASUSE and 
PLFS
•	
Reconciliation of production and expenditure-side estimates using the Supply and Use 
Tables (SUT) framework to address discrepancies in the existing series
In parallel, the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) is also being rebased to 2022-23, 
and is scheduled for release on 28 May 2026. The major methodological improvements 
proposed in the new series include:
•	
An updated item basket incorporating new and emerging industrial products, while 
removing obsolete items
•	
Selection and substitution of factories to ensure a representative sample and address 
closures and non-response
•	
Introduction of seasonal adjustment to smooth short-term variations
•	
Adoption of chain-based indices to enhance timeliness and representativeness
•	
Inclusion of “not elsewhere classified (n.e.c.)” items to better capture production
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is being rebased to 2024, using the latest consumption 
patterns from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2023-24, with 
state-specific item baskets and wider price coverage across urban and rural markets. The 
new CPI series is expected to be released on 12 February 2026.
Digital-first data dissemination
MoSPI has developed an integrated digital ecosystem to enhance the accessibility and 
usability of official statistics. The eSankhyiki Portal provides access to over 770 indicators, 
covering 18 statistical products and comprising approximately 136 million records 
sourced from MoSPI, RBI and other Ministries, through dashboards, APIs and customised 
downloads.
The Microdata Portal ensures structured access to unit-level data from 177 national surveys, 
aligned with internationally accepted metadata and documentation standards. Mobile access 
through the GoIStats app, extensive visualisation tools, and platforms such as PAIMANA24 
for monitoring large public projects, have significantly expanded the reach and impact of 
official data.
Towards data harmonisation and AI readiness
Efforts are underway to harmonise datasets across Ministries and States through common 
standards, classifications and unique identifiers. The National Metadata Structure (NMDS 
2.0) and the Statistical Quality Assessment Framework (SQAF), aligned with UN standards, 
aim to improve data quality, transparency and interoperability. Metadata repositories 
and standard operating procedures for resolving definitional divergences are laying the 
foundation for an integrated, AI-ready national statistical system.
Taken together, these reforms mark a shift from periodic data collection to a continuous, 
technology-enabled and policy-responsive statistical system, strengthening the foundations 
of evidence-based governance in India.

ASSESSMENT OF DOMESTIC MACROECONOMIC 
FUNDAMENTALS
Inflation dynamics in the economy
1.29.	 The demand-led growth in the economy has unfolded alongside a marked easing 
of inflation, which has improved real purchasing power and supported consumption. 
Domestic inflation dynamics in FY26 (April-December) reflect a broad-based easing 
in price pressures, led by a sharp disinflation in food prices (Chart I.21). Headline 
CPI inflation declined to 1.7 per cent, driven primarily by corrections in vegetable and 
pulse prices, supported by favourable farm conditions, supply-side interventions, and a 
strong base effect. While core inflation has exhibited persistence, this has been largely 
influenced by price spikes in precious metals; adjusting for these, underlying inflation 
pressures appear materially softer, indicating limited demand-side overheating. 
Looking ahead, the inflation outlook remains benign, supported by favourable supply-
side conditions and the gradual pass-through of GST rate rationalisation. However, the 
trajectory of core inflation will need to be closely monitored in the context of monetary 
policy easing and potential upward pressures from global base metal prices.

Supportive fiscal policy strategy underpinning domestic demand
1.30.	 The momentum in domestic demand and capital formation observed in FY26 
has been underpinned by a prudent fiscal policy strategy, characterised by steady 
revenue mobilisation and calibrated expenditure rationalisation. The gross tax revenue 
collection has progressed resiliently during the year, with direct tax collections reaching 
nearly 53 per cent of the budgeted annual target (as on November 2025). Indirect tax 
collections also remained robust despite lower inflation and import volatility, with 
gross GST collections in absolute terms recording multiple all-time highs during the 

State of the Economy

25
year. Recent tax policy reforms, including the restructuring of personal income tax 
and the rationalisation of the GST rate, have supported consumption demand while 
sustaining revenues in absolute terms. On the expenditure side, capital outlays recorded 
a strong year-over-year increase, reaching nearly 60 per cent of the budgeted allocation 
by November 2025. Also, the growth in revenue expenditure remained contained, 
reinforcing the quality of public spending.
1.31.	The central government’s fiscal trajectory stands out for combining consolidation 
with sustained public investment, earning three sovereign rating upgrades this year 
Between FY20 and FY25 (Provisional Actual), the share of capital spending in total 
central government expenditure increased from about 12.5 per cent to 22.6 per cent, 
while effective capex as a share of GDP rose from roughly 2.6 per cent to 4.0 per cent. 
Even as the states are overshooting their revenue deficit, the central government, 
through its Special Assistance to States for Capital Expenditure/Investment (SASCI), 
has successfully incentivised the States to maintain capital expenditure at around 2.4 
per cent of GDP. The expansion of unconditional cash transfers across several States 
has contributed to rising revenue expenditure, with implications for fiscal space and 
public investment at the state level (See Chapter II). Based on the broad trends observed 
during the year, the central government remains well on track to achieve its envisaged 
fiscal consolidation path, aiming to attain a fiscal deficit target of 4.4 per cent of GDP 
by FY26. As of November 2025, the union government’s fiscal deficit stood at 62.3 per 
cent of the Budget Estimates.

yields, which serve as benchmarks for borrowing costs across the economy, will itself 
act as a fiscal stimulus. Credit ratings agency, S&P Ratings, has acknowledged the 
credibility of and the commitment to the fiscal glide path, while upgrading India’s rating 
from ‘BBB-’ to ‘BBB’. CareEdge Global, in initiating its coverage of India, too assigned a 
‘BBB+’ rating, underscoring India’s robust economic performance and fiscal discipline. 
Monetary Transmission and the Changing Credit Mix
1.33.		 Alongside the fiscal stimulus provided by higher public capital expenditure and tax 
reductions, monetary support was delivered through a cumulative reduction of 125 basis 
points in the policy repo rate since February 2025 (as inflationary pressures moderated), 
complemented by an injection of durable liquidity via cash reserve ratio cuts (₹ 2.5 lakh 
crore25), open market operations (₹6.95 lakh crore26) and forex swap of around $25 billion. 
These measures have been effectively transmitted to the banking system. The weighted 
average lending rate (WALR) on fresh Rupee loans by scheduled commercial banks 
declined by 59 basis points (bps), while the WALR on outstanding Rupee loans declined 
by 69 bps between February and November 2025. Concurrently, the banking sector has 
further strengthened its balance sheets, with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratios 
declining to multi-decade lows of 2.2 per cent, the half-yearly slippage ratio27 remaining 
stable at 0.7 per cent, and profitability improving, supported by higher profit after tax 
and robust net interest margins. 
reliance on bank credit. In April-November 2025, within the overall flow of financial 
resources, there has been a significant increase in the flow from non-bank sources, 
(Chart I.24) which rose by 29.3 per cent YoY, alongside a robust expansion in non-food 
bank credit of 18.3 per cent (YoY).
External sector projected to be stable, but headwinds persist
10.6 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. FPI flows this year have 
been tepid due to elevated uncertainty and increased interest in AI-related financial 
investments in countries such as the US, Taiwan, and Korea. As a result, there was a 
balance of payments (BOP) deficit of USD 6.4 billion in H1 FY26 compared to a surplus 
of USD 23.8 billion in H1 FY25, which was funded by a decline in foreign exchange 
(forex) reserves. 
1.37.		 This widened BOP deficit, coupled with market uncertainty over the outcome of a 
trade deal with the US, has exerted pressure on the Indian Rupee, causing it to weaken. 
Between April 1 and January 22, 2026, the Indian rupee depreciated by approximately 
6.5 per cent against the US dollar. However, the movement in the INR has been orderly. 
Over the medium to long term, exchange rate dynamics are expected to be guided by 
structural fundamentals, such as productivity gains, export diversification towards 
higher-value goods and services, deeper integration into GVCs and a stable policy 
environment rather than short-term fluctuations.
1.38.	 India’s external sector is placed comfortably in the short run. Forex reserves 
cover over 11 months of imports as of 16 January 2026 and approximately 94.0 per cent 
of the external debt outstanding as of the end of September 2025, offering a comfortable 
liquidity cushion. The pursuit of a diversified trade strategy, as evidenced by the signing 
of trade agreements with the UK, Oman, and New Zealand and the EU, and active 
negotiations with US, bodes well for India’s exports. However, global developments 
are complicating the outlook in the medium term. A proliferation of immigration 
controls across countries typically favoured by Indian emigrants may cap the growth 
in remittances. Global trade is being increasingly influenced by geopolitical alignments 
and economic statecraft, which in turn may impact India’s exports. Therefore, it 
becomes imperative that one of the overarching priorities of India’s policies must be 
to enhance its competitiveness on the global stage and improve its attractiveness as an 
investment destination. Box IV.3 in Chapter 4, External Sector explores the drivers of 
success in attracting FDI in countries such as Vietnam and Taiwan, and outlines a way 
forward.
Labour market developments
1.39.	 India has witnessed improvements in the labour market, supported by 
a combination of regulatory reforms, expanded social protection, and targeted

skill development initiatives. Recent labour market indicators suggest improving 
employment conditions supported by ongoing structural reforms. Monthly PLFS 
data show a broadly steady labour market with seasonal variations (Chart I.26).  The 
quarterly averages of monthly estimates point to a decline in the unemployment rate 
and a stabilising labour force participation rate.
consolidation of 29 central laws into four Labour Codes aims to simplify compliance, 
enhance labour market flexibility, and extend security to a broader section of the 
workforce, while maintaining safeguards for wages, occupational safety, and social 
security. Importantly, the recognition of the gig and platform workers, with provisions 
to enable their registration and inclusion within social security schemes, marks a step 
towards formalising non-traditional forms of employment. Complementing these 
reforms, government-led skilling initiatives have focused on enhancing employability 
through industry-aligned training. Together, these measures aim to strengthen labour 
market resilience, improve job quality, and better align workforce capabilities with the 
The government responded by using this crisis as an opportunity to push through key 
measures such as GST rationalisation, faster progress on deregulation, and further 
simplification of compliance requirements across sectors. FY27 is therefore expected to 
be a year of adjustment, as firms and households adapt to these changes, with domestic 
demand and investment gaining strength. That said, it must be acknowledged that the 
external environment remains uncertain, which shapes the overall outlook.
1.43.	 The outlook for the global economy remains dim over the medium-term, with 
downside risks dominating. At the global level, growth is expected to remain modest, 
leading to broadly stable commodity price trends. Inflation across economies has 
trended downward, and monetary policies are therefore expected to become more 
accommodative and supportive of growth. However, certain key risks persist. If the AI 
boom fails to deliver the anticipated productivity gains, it could trigger a correction in 
overly optimistic asset valuations, with the potential for broader financial contagion. 
Additionally, a protraction of trade conflicts would weigh on investment and further 
weaken the global growth outlook. These forces collectively suggest that downside risks 
to global growth remain prominent, although a fragile stability holds for now.
1.44.	 For India, these global conditions translate into external uncertainties rather 
than immediate macroeconomic stress. Slower growth in key trading partners, tariff-
induced disruptions to trade and volatility in capital flows could intermittently weigh 
on exports and investor sentiment. At the same time, ongoing trade negotiations with 
the United States are expected to conclude during the year, which could help reduce 
uncertainty on the external front. While these risks remain manageable, they reinforce 
the importance of maintaining adequate buffers and policy credibility.
1.45.		 Against this backdrop, the domestic economy remains on a stable footing. 
Inflation has moderated to historically low levels, although some firming is expected to 
occur going forward. Balance sheets across households, firms and banks are healthier, 
and public investment continues to support activity. Consumption demand remains 

State of the Economy

31
resilient, and private investment intentions are improving. These conditions provide 
resilience against external shocks and support the continuation of growth momentum. 
The forthcoming rebasing of the CPI series in the coming year will also have implications 
for inflation assessment and warrant careful interpretation of price dynamics.
1.46.	 Importantly, the cumulative impact of policy reforms over recent years appears 
to have lifted the economy’s medium-term growth potential closer to 7 per cent (details 
in Box I.4). With domestic drivers playing a dominant role and macroeconomic stability 
well anchored, the balance of risks around growth remains broadly even. Taking these 
considerations together, the Economic Survey projects real GDP growth in FY27 in the 
range of 6.8 to 7.2 per cent. The outlook, therefore, is one of steady growth amid global 
uncertainty, requiring caution, but not pessimism.
Chapter 2 of the Economic Survey 2022–23 assessed India’s medium-term potential growth 
at around 6.5 per cent, with the possibility of rising to 7-8 per cent conditional on sustained 
structural reforms. The period since then allows a reassessment of whether the continued 
cycle of reforms in the economy has begun to strengthen the economy’s productive capacity, 
leading to an upward shift in potential growth. The Box argues that this is indeed the case.
Over the past three years, reform momentum has strengthened across several areas relevant 
for medium-term growth. Manufacturing-oriented initiatives, such as the Production-Linked 
Incentive (PLI) schemes, FDI liberalisation, and logistics reforms, have supported capacity 
creation. These efforts have been supported by sustained public investment in physical and 
digital infrastructure, with effective capex reaching 4 per cent of GDP. The simplification of 
tax laws and the establishment of various High-Level Committees for regulatory reforms, 
including those involving state governments, indicate a shift toward greater regulatory 
clarity and certainty. Measures targeted at MSMEs, including expanded credit guarantees, 
wider use of TReDS and the rollout of the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), have sought to 
ease credit constraints. 
These reforms have coincided with stronger corporate and financial sector balance sheets29, 
rising formalisation of employment30, and continued improvements in tax administration. 
Together, these developments make a persuasive case that India’s potential growth has risen 
to around 7 per cent over the medium term. The exercise uses a standard growth accounting 
framework, where the potential output is assessed with a Cobb–Douglas production 
function:
29 	Gross non performing asset has declined from peak of 11.2% in march 2018 to 3.9% in March 2023 and further 
to 2.2% as of September 2025. Core debt of private non-financial sector i.e., credit to the private non-financial 
sector as a percentage of GDP in India had come down from a peak of 107.8% in December 2010 to a low of 85.6 
% in March 2020.

Here, Y denotes output, K denotes capital stock, L is labour input, and A is total factor 
productivity (TFP). The parameters α and (1 – α) capture the output elasticities of capital 
and labour.  Taking logarithms and expressing in growth rates,
Δ ln Y = Δ ln A + α * Δ ln K + (1 – α) * Δln L                     ....(ii)
where Δln Y, Δ ln K and Δ ln L denote growth rates of output, capital stock and labour input, 
respectively, and Δ ln A represents growth in total factor productivity (TFP).
Using the above framework, this assessment examines whether each input component 
exhibits a higher sustainable trend reflecting the potential impact of reforms undertaken 
post-pandemic, along with an improvement in macro-financial fundamentals. The 
assumptions regarding capital stock growth, labour input growth, and growth in trend TFP 
used in the analysis are summarised in Table I.7. These assumptions are based on trends 
in data from National Accounts Statistics, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), and RBI’s 
KLEMS database.
1.  Capital stock growth highlights investment revival and capacity expansion
India’s capital stock grew at an average annual rate of about 8.6 per cent during the 
investment boom of FY03–FY12. However, growth moderated to around 7.6 per cent 
during FY13–FY20, reflecting balance sheet stress in the corporate and banking sectors, 
which weighed on investment and capital formation. The pandemic accentuated these 
constraints, resulting in a further slowdown in capital stock growth, followed by a 
recovery in the years after the pandemic. (Table I.7). 
The recovery has been supported by a sustained increase in public capital expenditure31, 
alongside improved investment capacity in the private sector. Compared to earlier 
episodes, the recent public capex push differs in two important respects. First, it has 
been sustained rather than episodic. Second, it has been accompanied by logistics, 
digital and regulatory reforms that improve the productivity of capital.
International evidence suggests that sustained public infrastructure investment can 
increase potential output by attracting private investment, particularly when financial 
sector balance sheets are healthy (IMF, 202032; World Bank, 202333). Consistent with 
this, private investment intentions have shown signs of revival, as reflected in capacity 
utilisation surveys and new project announcements.34 
31 	Between FY20 and FY25, the share of capital spending in total central government expenditure increased from 
about 12.5% to 22.6% (PA), while effective capex as a share of GDP rose from roughly 2.6% to 4.0%. In absolute 
on KLEMS estimates.35
The availability of PLFS data from 2017-18 onwards provides additional insights into 
labour market dynamics. The data points to rising participation rates, particularly among 
women, alongside increasing formalisation and social security coverage. However, since 
the pandemic, labour input growth36 has displayed volatility and unusual spikes. These 
movements reflect a combination of temporary labour market disruptions during the 
pandemic and accelerated formalisation during the recovery phase.
As economic activity normalised, labour market reforms gained traction. Labour law 
consolidation, reduced regulatory compliance and State-level regulatory reforms have 
begun to lower frictions in the labour market. At the same time, sustained investments in 
education, skilling and the apprenticeship ecosystem are strengthening workforce quality 
and employability. Taken together, these factors are likely to support a stabilisation of 
labour input growth over the medium term, at a level higher than pre-pandemic period. 
3.  Trend TFP: digital infrastructure and allocative efficiency
Trend TFP captures efficiency gains from better use of capital and labour. Using the 
capital stock and labour growth assumptions outlined above, the estimated trend TFP 
growth averaged around 1.9 per cent during the pre-pandemic period (FY13–FY20; 
refer to notes in the table below). However, in the immediate post-pandemic years, the 
estimated trend of TFP growth appears lower (Table 1.7). This pattern is consistent with 
developments observed across several emerging market economies, as documented in 
the Conference Board’s Total Economy Database.37 
Looking ahead, sustained reform momentum is expected to support a strengthening of trend 
TFP. Economy-wide adoption of public digital infrastructure, including Aadhaar, UPI and 
GSTN, has reduced transaction and compliance costs. Settlement cycles have shortened, and 
tax compliance has improved. Firm entry and exit have become easier, thereby improving 
allocative efficiency by allowing capital to move toward more productive activities.

Complementary reforms in physical infrastructure, logistics, insolvency resolution 
and regulatory simplification reinforce these digital gains. Together, these measures 
reduce coordination failures and lower the cost of scaling up production. At the same 
time, investments in education, skilling and apprenticeship frameworks support 
labour productivity. Rising formalisation improves labour market functioning and skill 
utilisation over time.
Together, these reforms enable higher output to be generated from a given set of factor 
inputs. While early gains were visible in financial inclusion, improved compliance, and 
service delivery, deeper productivity effects tend to materialise with a lag. Accordingly, 
the medium-term assessment assumes that trend TFP growth gradually improves and 
stabilises at a level same as the pre-pandemic average.

@ TFP growth is obtained as a residual from equation (ii) above, given the values of Y, K, L, α. The trend TFP 
growth is then estimated after smoothing the impact of covid disruptions in FY20-FY22.
Higher growth frontier
When combined, these calibrated improvements in capital accumulation, labour input and 
trend TFP generate an upward shift in potential GDP growth from 6.5 per cent to around 7 
per cent over the medium term. This reflects the compounding effect of sustained reforms 
interacting with strong macro-financial fundamentals. This assessment is buttressed by the 
higher growth trends observed in high-frequency indicators in recent years. Growth in e-way 
bill generation, PMI indices and non-food bank credit has remained persistently above their 
respective pre-pandemic averages, rather than reverting to previous growth trends. This 
performance suggests a more robust underlying pace of economic activity and an improved 
growth momentum.
International experience from East Asia in the 1990s to parts of Eastern Europe following EU 
accession suggests that such step-ups in potential growth are most credible when reforms
