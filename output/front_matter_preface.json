    "vii Preface Expectations and the reality of 2025 The year 2025 may have begun with one set of expectations and ended with another for the world, India included. However, one notable continuity has been India’s strong macroeconomic performance, evident in the post-Covid period. Growth was strong in the first quarter and continued to improve in the subsequent two quarters. The central bank cut interest rates aggressively and loosened liquidity conditions. Macroprudential measures put in place in 2023 were relaxed since the underlying conditions had changed. The government announced significant tax breaks for households in the budget for fiscal year 2026 (FY26) in February. It achieved a fiscal deficit of 4.8% of GDP, against the budgeted 4.9%, and announced a target of 4.4% for FY26, fulfilling the promise made in 2021 to reduce the Union fiscal deficit by more than half from 9.2% in FY21. India received credit rating upgrades from three credit rating agencies in 2025, starting with Morningstar DBRS in May, followed by S&P in August and R&I in September. S&P's upgrade of India from BBB- to BBB was India’s first credit rating upgrade from a major agency in nearly two decades.",
    "Although the President of the United States announced reciprocal tariffs of 25% on India in April, India was expected to strike an early agreement with the US administration and lower them. So, in August, when the American President announced an additional penal tariff of 25% on most of India’s merchandise exports to the United States on top of the reciprocal tariff of 25% announced in April, it surprised many since India was expected to be one of the early winners in the new tariff regime of the United States. Growth forecasts were revised downward.",
    "But in reality, growth accelerated due to a slew of structural reforms and policy measures.",
    "The government passed the most radical overhaul of the Goods and Services Tax since its inception in 2017. Budget announcements on opening up nuclear power generation to the private sector and the insurance sector to 100% foreign direct investment were implemented. The four labour codes were notified, and rules are expected to be in place in the next few months. The Ministry of Environment and Forests relaxed green cover norms for industries based on their polluting potential from the uniform 33% mandate. Indiscriminate Quality Control Orders, which adversely affected downstream industries, were put on hold. A sense of dynamism has taken hold in the government. Fast forward five months, and India is now anticipating a full- year real growth rate of over 7%, with another year of real growth at or near 7%. There is one wrinkle in the ointment, however.",
    "The paradox of 2025 is that India’s strongest macroeconomic performance in decades has collided with a global system that no longer rewards macroeconomic success with currency stability, capital inflows, or strategic insulation.",
    "A victim of geopolitics and a strategic power gap The Indian rupee underperformed in 2025. India runs a trade deficit in goods. Its net trade surplus in services and remittances is not enough to offset it. India depends on foreign capital flows to maintain a healthy balance of payments. When they run drier, rupee stability becomes a casualty.",
    "viii Growth is good; the outlook remains favourable; inflation is contained; rainfall and agricultural prospects are supportive; external liabilities are low; banks are healthy; liquidity conditions are comfortable; credit growth is respectable; corporate balance sheets are strong; and the overall flow of funds to the commercial sector is robust. Policy dynamism and purposeful governance reinforce this backdrop. The rupee’s valuation does not accurately reflect India’s stellar economic fundamentals. In other words, the rupee, therefore, is punching below its weight. Of course, it does not hurt to have an undervalued rupee in these times, as it offsets to some extent the impact of higher American tariffs on Indian goods, and there is no threat of higher inflation from higher-priced crude oil imports now. However, it does cause investors to pause. Investor reluctance to commit to India warrants examination.",
    "The Australia-based Lowy Institute’s Power Gap Index suggests that India is operating below its full strategic potential. India’s power gap score is -4.0, the lowest in Asia, excluding Russia and North Korea. India has its work cut out.",
    "It is a country of 145 crore people aspiring to become a richer country within a generation, within a democratic framework. India’s size and democracy preclude the possibility of templates worthy of emulation. With the global dominant power rethinking its economic and other commitments and priorities, throwing global trade into a welter of uncertainty and global frictions mounting and faultlines widening, India’s economic ambitions are confronting powerful global headwinds. Those same forces can be turned into tailwinds if the State, the private sector, and households are willing to align, adapt, and commit to the scale of effort that the moment demands. The task will be neither simple nor comfortable — but it is unavoidable.",
    "Three Global Scenarios for 2026 Although global growth and trade have held up better than expected, few are certain why this is the case. Hence, there is a lingering concern that the negative effects of the ongoing global political and economic turmoil may manifest with a lag. Fragility, uncertainty and episodic shocks are increasingly structural features of the system, and the balance of risks has shifted perceptibly over the past year. Geopolitical competition has intensified, the security environment in Europe has become increasingly complex, and financial vulnerabilities associated with leveraged technology investments are looming. Trade policy is now shaped primarily by security and political considerations rather than efficiency or multilateral rules.",
    "Taken together, these developments suggest a world that is less coordinated, more risk-averse, and more exposed to non-linear outcomes with a narrower margin of safety.",
    "Financial markets are already pricing this fragility. Gold rose from USD 2607 to USD 4315 per ounce in 20251, reflecting a weakening US dollar, expectations of persistently negative real rates, and the market’s growing assessment of geopolitical and financial tail risks.",
    "The best-case scenario for the world in 2026 is ‘business as in 2025’, but one that becomes increasingly less secure and more fragile. In this setting, with the margin of safety being thinner, minor shocks can escalate into larger reverberations. Financial stress episodes, trade frictions, and geopolitical escalations do not lead to systemic collapse, but they do create volatility and require governments to intervene more actively to stabilise expectations. This scenario is less about continuity and more about managed disorder, with countries operating in a world that As of 26th January 2026, the price of gold per ounce was USD 5101.34.",
    "remains integrated yet increasingly distrustful. One could attach a subjective probability of around 40% to 45% to this scenario unfolding in 2026. Reflecting this is the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index2, which is near its worst readings of 2020, excluding the sharp spike in April 2025 at the introduction of the reciprocal tariffs. Fear lingers. That brings us to the second scenario.",
    "In this scenario, the probability of a disorderly multipolar breakdown rises materially and cannot be treated as a tail risk. Under this outcome, strategic rivalry intensifies, the Russia–Ukraine conflict remains unresolved in a destabilising form, and collective security arrangements unravel. Trade becomes increasingly explicitly coercive, sanctions and counter- measures proliferate, supply chains are realigned under political pressure, and financial stress events are transmitted across borders with fewer buffers and weaker institutional shock absorbers. In this world, policy becomes more nationalised, and countries face sharper trade- offs between autonomy, growth, and stability. One could attach a probability of around 40% to 45% to this scenario as well.",
    "Let us, for a moment, focus on the possibility that financial stress events are transmitted across borders with fewer buffers in place.",
    "On the eve of Christmas 2025, the Financial Times wrote, “Tech companies have moved more than $120bn of data centre spending off their balance sheets using special purpose vehicles funded by Wall Street investors, adding to concerns about the financial risks of their huge bet on artificial intelligence.” The CEO of IBM openly questioned the economics of Large Language Models (LLM)-based AI, reinforcing concerns about the financial risks of this huge bet. Given the leverage involved, a correction could have cascading effects across financial markets and the real economy. The sharp rise in the yields of Japanese Government Bonds is another warning sign.",
    "This leads us directly to the third scenario, with a residual probability of 10%-20%, involving the risk of a systemic shock cascade in which financial, technological, and geopolitical stresses amplify one another rather than unfolding independently. The recent phase of highly leveraged AI-infrastructure investment has exposed business models that are dependent on optimistic execution timelines, narrow customer concentration, and long- duration capital commitments. A correction in this segment would not end technological adoption, but it could tighten financial conditions, trigger risk aversion and spill over into broader capital markets. If such developments were to coincide with geopolitical escalation or trade disruption, the resulting interaction could produce a sharper contraction in liquidity, a sudden weakening of capital flows, and a shift toward defensive economic responses across regions. While this remains a lower-probability scenario, its consequences would be significantly asymmetric. The macroeconomic consequences could be worse than those of the 2008 global financial crisis.",
    "Running a marathon and sprint at the same time In all three scenarios, India is relatively better off than most other countries due to its strong macroeconomic fundamentals, but this does not guarantee insulation. The country benefits from a large domestic market, a less financialised growth model, strong foreign exchange reserves 2\t https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GEPUCURRENT (as of 4th December 2025) and a credible degree of strategic autonomy. These features provide buffers in an environment where financial volatility is imminent and geopolitical uncertainty is permanent.",
    "At the same time, the three scenarios pose a common risk for India: disruption of capital flows and the consequent impact on the rupee. Only the degree and the duration will vary. In a world of geopolitical turbulence, this may not be confined to a year but could be a more enduring feature. In response, India needs to generate sufficient investor interest and export earnings in foreign currency to cover its rising import bill, as, regardless of the success of indigenisation efforts, rising imports will invariably accompany rising incomes. This has been the historical global experience.",
    "Economic policy must focus on the stability of supply, the creation of resource buffers, and the diversification of routes and payment systems. 2026 may mark the point at which policy credibility, predictability and administrative discipline cease to be mere virtues and instead become strategic assets in their own right, with lasting relevance. The appropriate stance for 2026 is therefore one of strategic sobriety rather than defensive pessimism. The external environment will require India to prioritise both domestic growth maximisation and shock absorption, with a greater emphasis on buffers, redundancy, and liquidity. Put differently, India must run a marathon and sprint simultaneously, or run a marathon as if it were a sprint.",
    "Economic Survey Reconfigured In its own way, this Economic Survey itself reflects the weight of the momentous changes happening elsewhere. First, this edition of the Economic Survey has seen its depth and breadth deepen and expand, respectively. It has seventeen chapters, and they have been rearranged. The arrangement of chapters, which previously relied on precedence, is now based on the depth and time-relevance of national priorities. Second, the Survey is longer this time than before, due to the range of issues and topics covered. Third, the Survey examines three topics of medium- to long-term interest to us in special essays: the evolution of Artificial Intelligence, the challenge of quality of life in Indian cities, and the roles of state capacity and the private sector (including households) in achieving strategic resilience and strategic indispensability.",
    "To whet your appetite, I discuss below some of the key issues covered in the various chapters of the Survey.",
    "Managing the General Government Deficit The chapter on fiscal developments deals more extensively with state finances than usual, as concerns over fiscal populism, the crowding out of capital expenditure by cash transfers, and the rise of revenue deficits in states have increased in recent times. The chapter emphasises that India’s fiscal credibility today rests on a deliberate shift toward capital formation and human capital investment, facilitated by strong revenue mobilisation and expenditure quality reforms.",
    "While the Centre has achieved consolidation alongside record public investment, rising revenue deficits and unconditional cash transfers in several States pose emerging risks by crowding out growth-enhancing spending. With Indian government bonds now globally indexed and investors increasingly assessing general-government finances, weak fiscal discipline at the State level can no longer be treated as locally contained—it increasingly affects the cost of sovereign borrowing. India’s 10-year bond yield is 6.7%, while Indonesia’s is 6.3%, even though both countries have the same credit rating of BBB. States’ fiscal priorities, perhaps, are casting a shadow on the sovereign’s borrowing cost, as investors focus on the fiscal parameters of the general government rather than just those of the Union government. More importantly, the economic costs of the insidious impact that unconditional fiscal transfers have on the incentives for self-improvement, upskilling, and employability may be more significant in the long term.",
    "The Cost of Capital and External Deficit The chapter ‘Monetary Management and Financial Intermediation’ makes a deeper claim about why capital remains expensive in India. Beyond the usual proximate explanations, such as policy rates, bank spreads, or inflation, the Survey argues that India’s high cost of capital is a structural macroeconomic outcome. A country that persistently runs current- account deficits and depends on foreign savings must, by definition, pay a risk premium to global capital. By contrast, economies that generate sustained external surpluses—through exports, productivity and financial depth—can finance investment cheaply and stably at home.",
    "India’s long-run challenge, therefore, is not merely to manage liquidity or credit cycles, but to transform itself into a surplus-generating economy. Only then can its cost of capital fall durably.",
    "For competitive businesses, the cost of capital is not the only input cost to consider. Energy is as important, if not more so. Indian businesses grapple with inverted input costs, whether in freight or electricity tariffs. ‘Net Zero’ transition has the potential to exacerbate this inversion.",
    "A recent documentary3 on Britain’s industrial landscape is useful in this regard. That is why the chapter on environment and climate change argues for sequencing, system readiness and finance reforms to deliver a green, competitive growth path without compromising energy security or development objectives.",
    "Surplus in Services Trade matters… up to a point The chapter, ‘External Sector’, examines India’s balance of payments, the determinants of currency strength or weakness, and the returns to FDI in India, reiterating the importance of pursuing Global Value Chains to establish their ecosystem in India. Currency strength, in general, or currency stability during crises, has always eluded countries that could not become successful and significant exporters of manufactured goods. Countries with strong, stable currencies are known for their manufacturing excellence. India’s export performance since the start of the millennium tells its own story. In general, services exports have outpaced goods exports. In particular, over the five years since 2020, the compounded annual growth rate of total exports has been 9.4%, while that of merchandise exports has been only 6.4%. Services have done much of the heavy lifting, creditable and macro-stabilising, but not a substitute for the goods-based export ecosystems that ultimately underpin durable external and currency stability.",
    "The Information Technology-Enabled Services Sector has been India’s mainstay for growth and exports since the dawn of the millennium. International experience indicates that while service exports are economically valuable, they do not systematically compel broad upgrades in state capacity, as successful firms can bypass weak institutions, relocate easily, and generate limited economy-wide pressure on governments to reform. Unlike 3\t See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQ3hT8tqZgo&t=19s xii manufacturing exports, they do not impose hard fiscal, employment, or logistical constraints on the State, allowing institutional weakness to persist even alongside globally competitive firms. So, manufacturing matters.",
    "India’s recent trade agreements are proof that we have taken note of this. A significant development in this regard is the recently concluded free trade agreement with the European Union after three years of negotiations, which will now require ratification by the European Parliament. In the current global context, the agreement expands market access for India’s labour-intensive manufactured exports while enabling deeper integration with Europe’s technological and manufacturing capabilities. The FTA with Europe can support the continent’s efforts to revitalise parts of its manufacturing base and, at the same time, strengthen India’s manufacturing competitiveness, export resilience and strategic capacity.",
    "Realising the potential of trade agreements requires that we can produce competitively.",
    "Getting Industrial Policy Right Manufacturing competitiveness and exports are important for maintaining long-term currency stability and strength. Moreover, when the security of supply of essential and infrastructure goods is no longer assured, manufacturing takes on a far greater strategic dimension. This creates a strategic need for resilience, which must, however, be balanced against the risk that high protection in upstream sectors (for example, textile fibre, steel and aluminium) raises costs for a much larger set of firms engaged in export-oriented production.",
    "Upstream industrialisation succeeds only when disciplined by global competition; protection that insulates it instead functions as a tax on downstream manufacturing and export performance. In that sense, decisions about what not to protect can be as important as decisions about what to support. That is what the East Asian experience, starting with Japan, reminds us of. Accordingly, the chapter on ‘Industry’s Next Leap’ argues that competitiveness will hinge on innovation, skilling, infrastructure/logistics and MSME scaling to embed India as a high- productivity manufacturing hub.",
    "Where upstream inputs are costly and capital-intensive, lowering their cost of capital is a more efficient way to support them than raising import protection, because it preserves downstream export competitiveness. That logic becomes unavoidable in a world where global manufacturing is anchored in China’s scale and integrated industrial systems, which effectively determine the international cost and technology frontiers that no national tariff wall can override. However, a lower cost of capital does not accrue easily to countries that are structurally savings-deficient (i.e., run current account deficits) and face enduring political incentives for fiscally accommodative policies. As a result, capital remains relatively expensive, and upstream producers find it more challenging to expand their scale or invest in efficiency; hence, they seek the lazier alternative of negotiated shelter. Yet without such expansion and efficiency gains, exports do not grow sufficiently to ease the current account constraint, and the underlying savings imbalance persists. The effort to correct one weakness thus creates another — a reminder of the endogeneity of macroeconomic outcomes.",
    "The exogenous factor is the government, with its ability to frame laws, set rules, raise or lower taxes and tariffs, provide and price utilities, grant approvals and licenses within a reasonable timeframe and incentivise indigenisation without sacrificing efficiency and engendering competitiveness.",
    "xiii Against this backdrop, the principal strategic risk for India is less about any single external shock and more about a mindset that downplays structural discontinuities. Avoiding this risk is possible.",
    "The Entrepreneurial State and more First, we need to re-imagine state capacity in all its dimensions. To borrow Mariana Mazzucato’s phrase, the state machinery needs to become an entrepreneurial state. The phrase, ‘an entrepreneurial state’, should not be misunderstood. It does not imply the commercialisation of the state, such as state capitalism, nor does it suggest a privileging of private interests. Rather, it refers to a deeper shift towards entrepreneurial policymaking under uncertainty: a state that can act before certainty emerges, structures risk rather than avoids it, learns systematically from experimentation, and corrects course without paralysis. This is not an abstract aspiration.",
    "India has already begun to see elements of this approach in practice: from the creation of mission-mode platforms in semiconductors and green hydrogen, to the restructuring of public procurement to enable first-of-a-kind domestic innovation, and to state-level deregulation compacts that replace inspection-based control with trust-based compliance. These are early signals of what an entrepreneurial state looks like when it moves from compliance to capability.",
    "Second, there is a need for a deeper system-level institutional capacity, including a capable state and a private sector that understands that this phase of India’s rise is not merely commercial but also geopolitical in its implications. Recent Economic Surveys have articulated a single, coherent architecture for India’s next phase of growth: multiple compacts linking the Union, the states, the private sector, academia and citizens, combined with deep and sustained deregulation. These are not separate themes but mutually reinforcing elements of a system in which the state sets direction, markets allocate effort, and society provides legitimacy. The state alone cannot pull the chariot of economic and social progress. The chapter on Education and Health focuses on the roles of the private sector and citizens in managing obesity, non- communicable diseases, and digital addiction, and on stronger education–skills–industry linkages to build a future-ready workforce.",
    "India’s structural transformation, currently underpinned by sustained growth and a broadly stable macroeconomic framework, provides the basis for translating our economic size and momentum into strategic influence. In an uncertain and contested world, an entrepreneurial state and industry that can think beyond itself are needed to sustain and succeed in that endeavour. For starters, it means the large private corporate sector eschewing the habit of seeking negotiated shelter, particularly at the expense of downstream small and medium enterprises, being open to import competition and becoming externally competitive.",
    "The final chapter (in two parts) of this Economic Survey brings together these three elements – state capacity, the society, and deregulation – in the pursuit of Viksit Bharat and global influence. A strong and stable currency would be a natural corollary of that.",
    "Ultimately, in a democracy, the state is the agency empowered to deliver and entrusted with the responsibility for development. For it to deliver on that goal, it must upskill and reskill and be mentally prepared to play a different game because the terrain is different and even hostile, the old rules no longer apply, and new rules are not yet in place. There is no other xiv choice. A possible eruption of multiple global crises, which presents an opportunity for India to play a meaningful role in shaping the global order that emerges, necessitates the most agile, flexible, and purposeful governance that India has ever been called upon to muster since its Independence.",
    "Drawing on Michael Beckley’s work on national power, this Survey frames power as the product of productive force, institutional quality, and strategic concentration. India has indeed achieved a good deal on the first two elements, and it is equally true that much remains to be done. Historic transition moments such as these carry a subtler danger: that institutions mistake procedure for purpose. Joseph Heller’s metaphor of a “Catch-22” captured how systems, once built to ensure safety and order, can end up entrapping those they are meant to serve—where every rule is followed, yet the outcome grows steadily more irrational. In a world of compounding shocks and geopolitical strain, India’s challenge is not merely to design better policies, but to ensure that rules, incentives and administrative reflexes serve national resilience.",
    "Policy reforms do matter. Process reforms arguably more so. Processes define the interaction between the government and the governed. So, they make all the difference to the success or failure of policy intent and reforms. The signs are very promising. The deregulation and smart regulation initiatives undertaken by states in the last year, in particular, provide ample grounds for optimism that the state machinery is capable of reinventing itself and its mission, shifting from regulation and control to enabling. Together with the Union Government’s economic reforms and other policy initiatives, this signals that the state understands the significance of the challenge and the need to rise to it.",
    "Upgrading India’s potential growth The first chapter on the ‘State of the Economy’ brings us back full circle to the present and the near term. The economy retains momentum, and growth is likely to be sustained into FY27.",
    "The chapter also introduces our nowcasting model, which integrates high-frequency indicators to assess growth in the ongoing and subsequent quarters. After three years of operational use and validation, the model has matured into a reliable tool for monitoring near-term macroeconomic conditions in real time.",
    "Accordingly, the Survey now revises India’s potential growth rate to 7.0 per cent, up from 6.5 per cent three years ago. At that time, we correctly anticipated weaker global tailwinds, particularly from exports, but also noted that sustained domestic reforms and public investment could lift the economy’s underlying growth capacity. That possibility is now being realised.",
    "The expansion of infrastructure — illustrated by the doubling of the airport network over the past decade and the rapid growth of freight movement through inland waterways — is easing logistics constraints and raising economy-wide efficiency.",
    "At the same time, while headline inflation continues to reflect volatility in food prices, the subdued trajectory of core inflation (excluding gold and silver) indicates a strengthening of supply-side conditions across the economy, consistent with rising productive capacity and improved logistics. In parallel, sustained state-level deregulation efforts are enabling small and medium enterprises to expand and integrate more effectively into formal value chains, elevating the economy’s medium-term growth potential.",

The mature mind chooses Śreya; the immature mind settles for Preya. In other words, the country stands to gain immensely when all of us embrace delayed gratification.",
    "The global environment is being reshaped by geopolitical realignments that will influence investment, supply chains and growth prospects for years to come. Against today’s global churn, India must choose to build resilience, innovate relentlessly, and stay the course toward Viksit Bharat, rather than seek quick fixes to visible, short-term pressures.",
    "The good news is that, on balance, the evidence presented in this Survey shows that India will choose well.",
    "It is time to step aside and let you dive into the Economic Survey. I hope you enjoy reading it and find the contents both enriching and enlightening. There are countless people to thank for the product in your hands. All errors are mine.",
