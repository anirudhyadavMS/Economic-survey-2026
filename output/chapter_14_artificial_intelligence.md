EVOLUTION OF THE AI 
ECOSYSTEM IN INDIA:  
THE WAY FORWARD
This chapter examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the global 
economy and outlines a pragmatic strategy for India in an environment 
marked by rapid technological change and persistent uncertainty. The chapter 
argues that India’s AI strategy should be grounded in its own economic realities, 
rather than attempting to replicate unsustainable models adopted in advanced 
economies. 
Given the constraints related to capital, computing capacity, energy, and 
infrastructure, pursuing scale for its own sake is neither efficient nor necessary. 
Instead, the chapter makes the case that a bottom-up, multiple sector-specific 
approaches under a single vision has the potential to pay dividends and turn into 
a source of dignified employment for India’s youth. India’s development of AI 
must be grounded in open and interoperable systems to promote collaboration 
and shared innovation. This pathway aligns more closely with India’s strengths 
in human capital, data diversity and institutional coordination. 
On governance, the chapter emphasises sequencing, enabling experimentation 
first, scaling next, and introducing binding obligations only where risks 
and asymmetries are most pronounced. The proposed framework for data 
governance strikes a balance between openness to cross-border flows and 
strengthening accountability and regulatory visibility. It is rooted in the objective 
of ensuring that the value accruing from India’s domestic data is retained within 
the country for the benefit of the people. The government’s role is framed as that 
of an enabler and coordinator, helping markets and institutions adjust in step 
with technological change. 
Overall, the chapter treats AI as a strategic choice. The central message is that 
India’s opportunity lies in deploying AI in a way that is economically grounded 
and socially responsive. 
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INDIA’S ECONOMIC CONTEXT
Introduction: What we know, and what we still don’t
14.1.	When the Economic Survey last examined Artificial Intelligence (AI) in early 2025,

the conversation, both globally and in India, was still dominated by the possibilities and 
potential of AI. While AI was already visible in some areas as a productivity-enhancing 
tool or embedded within some service platforms, its broader economic implications 
remained largely conjectural. The focus of the chapter, therefore, was appropriately 
placed on preparedness, discussing skills, data, infrastructure, and institutional 
readiness. 
14.2.	 One year on, the conversation has definitely shifted. AI is no longer a distant 
or speculative technology. It is increasingly being adopted, even if in an experimental 
capacity, in organisations around the world. Based on a survey of 1993 firms by 
McKinsey, 88% of organisations surveyed in 2025 reported that they are utilising AI 
in at least one of their business functions.1 Of those using it, 31% are in the process of 
scaling its application across the organisation, while 7% have already fully deployed 
and integrated AI.

14.3.	 Although utilisation is currently concentrated in High-Income countries 
(accounting for 58.4% of all usage in April 2025), utilisation in Upper- and Lower-
Middle-Income countries has also expanded (22.5% and 18.7%, respectively).2 
Innovations and continuous improvement in AI capabilities are driving firms and new 
start-ups to develop ways in which AI can be applied to solve real-world problems.

14.4.	 At the same time, greater visibility into AI adoption has also brought greater 
clarity on the nature of the technology itself. Over the past year, it has become evident 
that while the use of AI tools can be widespread, the frontier of AI remains highly 
concentrated. The development and training of advanced foundational models is 
increasingly capital-, compute-, data- and energy-intensive, favouring a small set of 
firms with access and the political capital to secure large-scale infrastructure projects, 
specialised hardware, and deep pools of technical talent. 
14.5.		 Early evidence has also begun to temper some of the more extreme predictions 
surrounding AI’s near-term labour impact. For instance, a study conducted by Yale’s 
Budget Lab indicates that the broader labour market in the United States has not 
experienced a discernible disruption due to AI.3 Similarly, a study by Brynjolfsson, 
Chandar, and Chen (2025)4 highlights that the difference in job prospects between 
occupations highly exposed to AI and those with relatively low exposure is minor. 
According to Renault (2025), most Danish workers also benefit from the adoption of 
AI5. The emerging evidence does provide some reassurance in the near term, especially 
for labour-abundant economies such as India.
14.6.	 However, this does not invite complacency, especially from a policymaker’s 
perspective. While labour may be complemented in the near term as organisations work 
to incorporate AI into their tasks, productivity gains from augmentation have a ceiling, 
as highlighted in Box XIII.2 of the Economic Survey 2024-25. Further, Box XIV.1 
demonstrates a meaningful structural shift in the interaction between employment and 
output, using the United States as a case study. All in all, caution is still warranted as 
India attempts to solve the puzzle of AI and labour. This represents one of the most 
considerable looming uncertainties about the technology.
Box XIV.1: Employment in the AI-Salient Period - Evidence from the U.S. 
Service Sector
Public debate on the labour market implications of AI is highly polarised. One camp predicts 
large scale displacement while the other side notes that the effect of AI on labour markets 
will remain muted for the foreseeable future. These views are often framed in terms of labour 
substitution vs augmentation, yet empirical evidence capable of distinguishing between 
these outcomes remains scarce. The reason no definitive conclusions have been reached on 
anything AI-related is twofold. One, AI is relatively new and integrating it into existing

economic structures is not straightforward. Two, considering that AI is still undergoing 
constant development, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding its capabilities and costs. 
Enterprises want to take risks and adopt AI, but also avoid being the ones who get it wrong.
However, the core uncertainty is not whether AI matters for this sector, but how and when 
it will manifest. Technological transitions do not arrive overnight as instantaneous shocks. 
Evidence from past automation waves suggests that early-stage adoption complements 
labour, with substitution pressures only emerging once the market saturates and productivity 
gains no longer lead to significant cost reductions. 
Against this backdrop, our analysis examines employment dynamics in the United States’ 
professional, business and information service sector, focusing on non-supervisory private-
sector workers. The United States is used as a case study because its white-collar and 
services-heavy labour market sits closest to the technological frontier of AI adoption. Any 
dynamics observed can offer early-signals and policy-relevant insights for India as its own 
services-led economy moves along a similar, albeit lagged, trajectory.
Using a time-series framework, the analysis evaluates whether the period coinciding with 
the widespread introduction of Generative AI tools is associated with a change in the 
relationship between employment, output, wages, and financial conditions. Our analysis is 
explicitly framed as an assessment of structural change rather than a test of causal effects. 
Estimation and Findings
An Autoregressive Distributed Lag model was estimated with nonsupervisory employment 
in the Professional, Business, and Information Services (PBIS) sector as the dependent 
variable for the period from March 2016 to July 2025. Explanatory variables include the 
average hourly wages in the sector, the federal funds rate to account for the cost of borrowing, 
a monthly real GDP series created by S&P, and the consumer price index. To assess potential 
structural change in employment dynamics, the model incorporates a post-December 2022 
regime binary dummy, corresponding with the period of heightened salience of GenAI tools, 
along with an interaction between this regime indicator and real output.
Our estimates indicate a change in the employment dynamics of the PBIS sector during the post-
December 2022 period. Rather than indicating a discrete break in employment levels, the estimates 
point to a change in how employment responds to output growth in the post-2022 period.
Conditional on wages, output, and the interest rate, the post-December 2022 regime 
indicator is positively associated with PBIS employment, both in the short- and long-run. This 
association is interpreted as a structural shift in employment dynamics during the AI-salient 
period, rather than as evidence of direct causal effect of AI adoption. At the same time, the 
interaction between the post-2022 regime indicator and real GDP is negative and statistically 
significant across both time-horizons. This implies that relative to pre-2022, the marginal 
responsiveness of PBIS sector employment to output growth is lower in post-2022 regime.
Sect0ral Contrast and Falsification Exercise
To assess whether the post-2022 regime indicator captures a sector specific structural

shift rather than a broader macroeconomic phenomenon, an alternative specification was 
estimated using private sector non-supervisory employment that excludes the PBIS sector. 
The results reveal a stark difference. 
In the non-PBIS sector, the post-2022 indicator is associated with a modest short-run 
coefficient and a near zero, statistically insignificant long-run coefficient. This stands in 
contrast to the PBIS estimates, where the corresponding short-run coefficient is substantially 
larger and the long-run association remains statistically significant. 
The divergence suggests that the structural change identified in the PBIS sector is not a 
general feature of post-pandemic labour market dynamics, monetary conditions, or 
aggregate demand recovery. Instead, it appears to be concentrated in sectors characterised 
by higher sensitivity and exposure to GenAI tools. 
To reiterate, this does not imply that GenAI has directly affected employment in PBIS 
while leaving others untouched. Rather, it demonstrates that the PBIS sector is exhibiting a 
markedly distinct adjustment pattern. The sectoral contrast strengthens the interpretation 
of the post-2022 dummy as capturing a meaningful structural shift rather than a purely 
cyclical or economy-wide effect. 
Discussion
The results suggest that employment adjustment in the PBIS sector is more nuanced than 
the polarised debate around AI-driven job losses would imply. Rather than indicating an 
abrupt contraction in employment, the estimates point to a change in how employment 
responds to output growth in the post-2022 period. 
In this context, the positive association between the post-2022 indicator and PBIS employment 
is best interpreted as reflecting organisational and structural adjustments during a period of 
heightened technological salience. Firms may be expanding or reallocating labour to integrate 
new systems, manage workflows, and redesign service delivery, consistent with earlier findings 
that productivity-enhancing technologies can initially complement labour in sectors with 
elastic demand (Bessen, 20196; Albanesi et al., 20247). This may also be why a recent study 
published by Yale8 found no net-negative effects of AI on labour demand in the United States. 
Then why do many experts focus so much on automation and the potential for AI-induced 
displacements? Why are policymakers concerned about the adverse consequences of AI 
diffusion? This can be explained by the coefficient of the interaction term included in our 
model. The negative interaction between the post-2022 indicator and output suggests that 
marginal responsiveness of employment to economic growth has weakened relative to the 
pre-2022 period. Or put simply, the labour intensity of output has marginally declined. 
While this does not constitute evidence of task-level automation, it does indicate a shift in 
aggregate employment elasticities under a new technological regime.

Taken together, the estimates imply that policymakers and firms might witness a non-
linear labour market trajectory. Unless the labour market adapts and new skills are learned, 
which alter the profile and types of jobs people are engaged in, we may observe even more 
reductions in the labour-intensity of GDP in the future. Paraphrasing the words of T.S. 
Elliot, the change comes not in a single shock, but in a quiet, steady drift.

14.7.	Uncertainty also extends into the evolving structures of the global AI ecosystem. 
Control over critical inputs, such as data, compute, models, and standards, is increasingly 
concentrated. This raises concerns about market power, technological dependence, and 
the resilience of supply chains. It also raises a substantial question about the future of 
India’s IT sector, as firms that once relied on India’s comparative advantage to handle a 
bulk of their work may no longer need to do so. It risks hollowing out India’s core value 
proposition if adaptation lags. If the country is to sustain its competitive edge in IT, a 
comprehensive evolution is necessary, one that takes full advantage of the potential 
embedded in AI development and deployment.

14.8.	 Another source of uncertainty pertains to defining a regulatory approach to AI. 
Countries diverge in how they design their institutions to address AI-related challenges, 
reflecting differing priorities. For advanced economies, their decisions will determine 
how AI can be leveraged to enhance productivity in the face of labour shortages and an 
ageing population. For India, the challenge is to govern AI in a manner that is sensitive 
to its economic realities. The choices that India’s own institutions make will play a 
central role in determining not only the pace of AI diffusion but also how its economic 
value is distributed across sectors and among people. 
14.9.	 The question, therefore, is how India positions itself within an ecosystem 
marked by rapid technological change, concentrated capabilities, limited resources 
and persistent uncertainty. Will it remain primarily a consumer of AI technologies or 
emerge as a meaningful contributor to their development and deployment? This is what 
the chapter aims to contribute towards. 
14.10.	 In the sections that follow, we outline the trade-offs that India will have to 
contend with and how the nation can evolve its AI ecosystem in a manner that best 
aligns with its goals. The following sub-section details the trade-offs and asymmetries 
involved in building an AI ecosystem. Sections 2 to 4 highlight the strategic necessity 
of India’s own AI solution and propose practical steps that can be taken to evolve the 
ecosystem, including AI model and application development, human capital, and how 
governance needs to evolve, including a framework for incentivising data localisation. 
Section 5 highlights the various safety concerns that policymakers must be aware of. 
Section 6 puts forth a phased deployment proposal, and concludes.
Asymmetries and Trade-offs in the AI Ecosystem
14.11.	 The AI ecosystem is characterised by pronounced asymmetries across countries, 
firms, capabilities, and stages of the value chain. These asymmetries are not incidental; 
they are structural outcomes of how AI is financed, developed and deployed. For India, 
recognising these asymmetries is essential, as policy choices in AI are constrained by 
the trade-offs these asymmetries present to the country.
Frontier versus Application: Capability Asymmetries 
14.12.	 At the core of the global AI divide lies a sharp distinction between frontier model 
development and application-led development. While AI usage has been growing, as 
highlighted by the World Bank report cited earlier, the capability to design and train large 
foundational models remains highly concentrated in the hands of a few large firms. These 
firms exercise significant control over the market and exert high demand pressures on 
the resources necessary for AI, allowing them to erect high barriers to entry. 

Economic Survey 2025-26
556
556
14.13.	 Add to this the export restrictions imposed on the most advanced processors 
required for scaling up frontier model development, and the task ahead of India 
becomes extremely challenging. This creates a fundamental asymmetry: most 
countries may end up participating in AI primarily as users, while a few will shape 
the technology's trajectory, standards, cultural leanings, and pricing. Attempting 
to close this gap would involve prohibitive fiscal costs towards what is increasingly 
becoming an unsustainable approach to AI development. The trade-off, therefore, 
is between expending scarce resources to chase frontier-scale models or deploying 
those resources more effectively towards domain-specific AI systems aligned with 
domestic economic priorities. 
Scale versus Inclusion: Capital-Labour Trade-offs
14.14.	 AI adoption alters incentives within firms by raising the marginal productivity 
of capital relative to labour, particularly in white-collar service sectors. Firms driven by 
cost reductions and maximising productivity gains are more inclined to rapidly scale 
up AI adoption10, increasing the likelihood of capital-labour substitution in specific task 
categories. Most of these tasks are concentrated in the low-value-added segments of the 
service sector, and high exposure to AI11 means firm leadership may view these jobs as 
redundant. 
14.15.	 For labour-abundant economies such as India, this creates a tension between 
aggregate productivity gains and employment absorption. Rapid, uncalibrated 
deployment of AI may boost output but risks displacing segments of the workforce 
faster than the economy can reabsorb them. Conversely, delaying adoption to protect 
jobs may risk locking firms into a low productivity equilibrium. The policy challenge, 
therefore, is not whether to adopt AI, but how to pace its diffusion so that labour 
augmentation can be facilitated.
Open versus Proprietary Models: Cost, Control, Dependence
14.16.	 Another asymmetry lies in the ownership and governance of AI models. The 
most widely deployed AI models are proprietary and opaque, limiting transparency 
around their training data, internal logic, and update mechanisms. Since these models 
are essentially black boxes, users can never know what changes are being made to the 
underlying source code and how it might be altering the behaviour of the AI model. 
14.17.	 In contrast, open-source models and open-weight models offer lower entry barriers, 
greater adaptability, and reduced vendor lock-in. However, they also include trade-offs

related to quality control and fragmentation if not guided by a coherent national strategy. 
India’s challenge is to strike a balance between openness and stewardship, leveraging 
shared innovation while ensuring that the economic value created from domestic data 
and intellectual property accrues within India rather than being captured abroad. 
Compute Intensity versus Resource Constraints
14.18.	 AI development is inextricably linked to physical infrastructure. Data centres 
require large quantities of electricity12 and water13, and AI workloads introduce volatility 
into power demand, posing risks to grid stability14. Global experiences show that AI-
driven data centre expansion can place significant strains on existing energy systems, 
even in advanced economies. 
14.19.	 In a recent Congressional testimony, Mark P. Mills, senior fellow at the 
Manhattan Institute noted, “The unprecedented digital construction underway has 
led to the rediscovery of a basic truth: All software exists inside hardware that, in 
turn, uses energy, a lot of it. Each digital byte uses an infinitesimal amount of energy. 
But here we find salience for the euphemism that quantity has a quality all its own. 
Again, in moonshot terms: the amount of energy used to launch a rocket is consumed 
every day by just one AI-infused datacenter."15   
14.20.	Similarly, the CEO of IBM raised concerns about the financial viability of the 
capital expenditures being undertaken for data centre expansion16. With some firms 
projected to burn half a trillion in cash by 2030 while pursuing compute infrastructure 
12	 To grasp the scale of electricity demand from AI data centres, one need only look at the recent revision by the 
U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Previously, the EIA had projected a modest 2 % annual growth 
in electricity consumption through 2026. In light of the rapid expansion of AI-driven data centre activity, the 
forecast has been sharply revised upwards, to 3 % growth in 2025 and 5 % in 2026. See Short-Term Energy 
Outlook, June 2025. US Energy Information Administration.
13	 AI Data Centers consume upto 20 lakh litres of water per day, and globally, they consume 56,000 crore litres of 
water annually (as recently reported by Bloomberg, https://tinyurl.com/wsdmmbjr). If India scales up AI Data 
Centers, it has the potential to add an extraordinary amount of stress on our already strained groundwater and 
freshwater reserves. Also see analysis from the University of Illinois (https://tinyurl.com/yc5fax8j), Stanford 
University (https://tinyurl.com/bbce9en5), and the New York Times (https://tinyurl.com/mr283x7f). 
14	 For instance, an incident on 10th July 2024 in Northern Virginia demonstrated how the simultaneous loss of 
1500 MW of load from the data centres caused significant voltage depression and frequency deviation in the 
power grid. Swift intervention by the grid operators prevented a massive surge in the electrical systems, only 
narrowly avoiding a total blackout in the region. The incident demonstrates how the proliferation of AI Data 
centres across India can add significant strain to the grid. The integration and power usage of AI Data Centres 
is a topic that requires separate and serious consideration. See North American Electric Reliability Corporation

creation for AI17,  the risks of a financial contagion18  stemming from the unprecedented 
scale of a debt fuelled expansion19 remains high. 
14.21.	 For India, as power, finance, and especially water remain binding constraints, 
scaling compute indiscriminately carries opportunity costs. Investment in AI 
infrastructure competes directly with other sources of demand, such as households and 
industries. This creates a trade-off between centralised scale and distributed efficiency, 
strengthening the case for smaller, task-specific models that can run on limited 
hardware and decentralised compute networks.  
Regulation versus Innovation
14.22.	An age-old trade-off that policymakers must always contend with is the balance 
between sustaining innovation and designing regulatory frameworks intended to keep 
the broader public safe. Furthermore, the trade-off between the two is inherently 
asymmetric across countries. Regulatory compliance, aimed at ensuring safety, 
controlled proliferation, auditing, transparency, or mitigating liability exposure, 
imposes fixed costs that may scale poorly for smaller firms and those involved in early-
stage experimentation. 
14.23.	Frontier AI ecosystems in high-income countries and other cash-rich large 
firms often demonstrate a capacity to absorb these costs. India’s more fragmented 
and resource-constrained innovation landscape could be stifled if the same degree of 
regulations were binding. 
14.24.	However, very minimal or completely absent regulatory clarity can undermine 
trust, slow adoption, and create systemic risks, particularly as AI is deployed in critical 
sectors such as healthcare, education, governance, or finance. The challenge for India, 
therefore, is how and when to regulate AI.
Strategic Autonomy versus Global Integration
14.25.	Lastly, AI has emerged as a geostrategic asset. Export controls on advanced 
chips, restrictions on technology transfer, and the weaponisation of software and inputs 
necessary to build AI infrastructure have underscored the risks of overdependence on 
foreign systems. As AI applications diffuse into critical sectors and public institutions, 
these dependencies carry systemic risks.

14.26.	Yet, complete technological self-sufficiency is neither feasible nor efficient. The 
trade-off, therefore, lies between strategic autonomy and continued integration with 
global innovation networks. India’s policy choices must navigate this balance carefully, 
preserving openness where it enhances capability while insulating critical functions 
from external shocks. 
14.27.	 These asymmetries do not imply that India is at a structural disadvantage in the 
AI era. Instead, they define the constraints within which a viable and sustainable AI 
strategy must be formulated. The sections that follow build on this diagnosis to outline 
pathways that seek to maximise economic and social returns from AI while remaining 
mindful of the trade-offs. 
A DEVELOPMENT-ORIENTED APPROACH TO AI
The necessity of India’s own AI solution
14.28.	The AI ecosystem remains sufficiently young that existing imbalances and 
constraints need not define its future trajectory. This creates an opening for India to 
shape a more value-creating and dignified employment opportunity for its workforce. 
As NITI Aayog’s report highlights, there are numerous potential benefits to indigenous 
AI development20. Multinational IT companies have thus far benefited from “low-cost 
labour” in India, but AI presents an opportunity to shift perceptions and structurally 
change the reality of India’s labour market. 
14.29.	Secondly, developments in AI will have natural spillovers into existing sectors 
such as services, manufacturing, defence and power. In this context, reliance on foreign

multinationals for AI-based solutions will leave India vulnerable to shifts in geopolitics, 
potentially constraining the country’s future diplomatic choices. Just as critical minerals 
and semiconductors are utilised to shape foreign policy, AI capability and resources will 
similarly be utilised for geostrategic negotiations.21
14.30.	Accordingly, AI should not be regarded merely as a technological advancement, 
but as a strategic priority with far-reaching implications for the future of India’s critical 
infrastructure, labour market, foreign policy and culture.
Box XIV.2: Identifying Bottlenecks to AI Compute Expansion -  
An Agent Based Model Approach
As discussed earlier in the chapter, the availability of sufficient compute capacity in 
India is a necessary condition for the training and development of cutting-edge models. 
However, surging demand for inputs (driven by higher GPU demand) and constrained 
supply conditions (due to shortages in the availability of high-bandwidth memory chips and 
storage) are driving cost concerns22. This, in turn, is bound to have a ripple effect on the cost 
of expanding compute capacity in India making financial viability a possible bottleneck. 
Similarly, higher demand from buyers abroad can choke the available supply of GPUs23. 
Thus, even if the sovereign, domestic investors, or financial institutions are willing to finance 
data centre expansion, plans may need to be put on hold until GPU supplies are secured. 
In this context, the objective of this exercise is to examine how the expansion of data centre 
and AI compute capacity is shaped by the interaction of financial constraints, infrastructure 
readiness, and external supply dependencies.
To do so, the exercise adopts an Agent Based Modelling (ABM) approach where financing, 
grid availability and hardware access are allowed to interact and shape one another through 
feedback loops. The focus is on identifying conditions under which coordination failures 
emerge, even in the presence of strong underlying demand. 
The exercise is intended as a policy stress test rather than a forecasting tool. It does not 
aim to estimate optimal capacity levels or precise investment requirements. Instead, it is 
designed to surface structural vulnerabilities in the AI infrastructure ecosystem, identify 
leverage points where policy interventions may be most effective, and clarify the limits of 
price-based or subsidy-led approaches when financial and infrastructural constraints are 
binding, as is the case for India.

geopolitics in their own favour. AI is expected to be used in a similar way.

The simulation was run for a period of 40-quarters, capturing the evolution of constraints 
over the medium-term.
Scenario 1: Baseline
For the baseline scenario, demand for data centre capacity is assumed to grow at a rate of 24% 
per annum, which is on the conservative side of expectations24. Power tariffs start at ₹8 per 
kWh, and are elastic within the system. Additional power capacity is added to the grid with a 
lag of 12 quarters and the cost of borrowing for data centre operators at baseline is set at 9% 
per annum. Based on the above configuration, the system is setup and simulated. Letting the 
model run for 40 quarters, in discrete time, reveals the outcomes of our baseline scenario. 
At base, the model exhibits a sequencing of bottlenecks over time, rather than a simultaneous 
binding of constraints. In the early quarters, the dominant friction is access to finance, as 
operators attempt to scale capacity ahead of realised revenues. Despite strong and steadily 
growing domestic demand, balance-sheet constraints and investor hurdle rates initially 
prevent a subset of firms from expanding, leading to a short-lived spike in entities waiting 
for finance. As revenues accumulate from the rising cost of compute and margins stabilise, 
this financial bottleneck eases, indicating that under normal macro-financial conditions, 
financing constraints are not permanently binding but act as an initial filter on expansion 
timing.

As the simulation progresses, the primary constraint shifts toward GPU availability. Even 
with “normal” global supply conditions and India’s GPU share in global demand set at a 
realistic 4%, the probabilistic access mechanism and minimum lead times result in a 
persistent and growing pool of operators waiting for hardware. This bottleneck dominates 
for most of the simulation horizon, suggesting that hardware access, rather than pricing or 
power availability, becomes the central limiting factor in sustained capacity expansion.

Grid-related constraints emerge only episodically but remain secondary. Overall, the 
baseline outcome illustrates a system where demand is not the binding constraint; instead, 
expansion is paced by the slowest-moving complementary inputs, with hardware supply 
uncertainty exerting the longest lasting drag on scale-up.
Scenario 2: Elevated Foreign GPU Demand (Relative to Baseline)
In the second scenario, foreign demand is set to expand at almost double the pace of the 
baseline scenario, with all other factors remaining the same. Running the simulation for 
40 quarters once again sheds light on some interesting dynamics. Higher foreign demand 
directly impacts the price of GPUs, worsening project economics by increasing upfront capex 
required and challenging the financial viability of data centre projects in India. Higher prices 
also weigh down on the profitability margins and the debt service capacity of data centres, 
making investors and banks reluctant to finance further expansion. The financial bottleneck 
remains a binding constraint for significantly longer than in the baseline.

Over time, even as a subset of operators gradually overcome initial financing constraints due 
to the rising cost of compute contributing to increased revenues, uncertainty around global 
GPU supply continues to bind. While balance sheets improve and access to finance partially 
normalises, elevated global demand keeps GPU availability probabilistic and delivery timelines 
uncertain. This creates a second-order constraint: projects that are financially viable on paper 
are still unable to proceed due to unresolved hardware access. The result is a decoupling between 
financial readiness and execution capability, underscoring that easing domestic financial 
constraints alone is insufficient when hardware supply remains externally constrained.
Scenario 3: High Domestic Demand with liberal financing (Relative to Baseline)
In scenario 3, foreign demand is returned to baseline but India’s demand is now set to grow 
at 32% per annum. India’s share in global GPU demand is increased to 6% a year. To ensure 
there is sufficient finances available to fund the growing appetite, investor hurdle rates are

lowered to 10% (relative to 15% for the baseline scenario), and the financial system is flush 
with liquidity. This reduces the incidence and duration of financing bottlenecks in scenario 
3, with a lesser number of operators waiting for a decreased period of time (2 less quarters 
relative to baseline) to avail funding.

However, the relaxation of financial constraints does not translate into proportionate capacity 
addition. Instead, the dominant bottleneck shifts decisively to GPU availability, with grid 
constraints appearing intermittently as utilisation rises. Higher domestic demand accelerates the 
pace at which projects reach the execution stage, but hardware access remains governed by global 
supply conditions. As a result, a large share of operators accumulate in the “waiting for GPUs” 
state for much of the simulation horizon. Compared to the baseline, the system moves faster 
into this hardware-constrained regime, while compared to Scenario 2, the constraint emerges 
despite favourable global conditions, underscoring that abundant capital and strong demand are 
insufficient to overcome physical and geopolitical limits in advanced hardware supply chains.
Concluding Thoughts
Across all scenarios, a recurring pattern is that developments in global GPU supply chains 
play a meaningful role in shaping the long-run pace of AI infrastructure expansion. This 
persists even when domestic demand conditions are strong and financial constraints are 
eased, highlighting an important consideration for India’s AI strategy: capacity expansion 
may be influenced by the structure and concentration of global hardware supply chains. As 
a result, conventional policy levers to expand access to finance and incentivise domestic 
development of AI may need to be complemented by measures that enhance supply-side 
resilience in access to advanced compute. In this context, India’s AI strategy will, in the 
medium term, need to rely on diversified and resilience access to global compute. Over time, 
the objectives of the National Semiconductor Mission highlighted in Chapter 8, are expected 
to evolve toward building domestic capabilities that can progressively meet a larger share of 
India’s advance compute demand.

Bottom-up approach to AI development in India
14.31.	 The global AI ecosystem has diverged along two distinct development paths. 
Sector leaders in the West have pursued a top-down strategy centred on frontier models, 
massive private capital, significant expenditures on computing infrastructure, and 
the concentration of intellectual property within a small number of hyperscale firms. 
Elsewhere, by contrast, a bottom-up approach, characterised by distributed innovation 
across firms and sectors, strong state coordination, and an emphasis on application-
specific AI rather than frontier model supremacy, is the norm. India’s position in this 
landscape, reflecting a distinct set of constraints and capabilities, make a bottom-up 
approach strategically necessary. 
14.32.	India enters the AI era with notable strengths. It ranks among the top global 
contributors to AI research output25 and possesses a deep pool of technical talent in the 
field of artificial intelligence.26 The country also has a highly AI-literate labour force, 
outranked only by the United States as of 2024.27 India also holds a considerable potential 
comparative advantage in terms of its own domestic data sources. The heterogeneity 
and scale of our country suggest the possibility of curating diverse domestic datasets 
across various sectors, including health, agriculture, finance, education, and public 
administration. This asset remains underutilised.

14.33.	At the same time, India’s access to cutting-edge compute infrastructure is limited, 
financial resources for large-scale model training are scarce, and private participation 
in foundational AI research remains relatively muted compared to global leaders. 
These constraints render the pursuit of foundational models as the centrepiece of an 
AI strategy challenging28. A bottom-up approach to AI development aligns more closely 
with these realities. 
14.34.	This strategy also recognises that value creation in AI need not be concentrated in 
a small number of frontier models or firms. Early adopters who scaled under conditions 
of abundant capital and weak regulatory frameworks are now locked into a system 
characterised by high energy intensity, opaque development practices, ballooning 
financial commitments, and uncertain revenue models. Being a late mover gives India 
the benefit of hindsight, allowing policy and innovation choices to be shaped with 
greater intentionality. India must avoid costly path dependencies and unsustainable 
design choices that have been observed elsewhere. 
14.35.	In this context, the proposed approach prioritises application-specific, small 
models that are tailored to defined uses and sectoral needs29. Such models are 
significantly more computationally efficient, easier to fine-tune, and capable of running 
on locally available hardware, such as smartphones or personal computers, making them 
better suited to India’s existing infrastructure base. Crucially, they allow innovation to 
emerge from a broader set of actors, including start-ups, research institutions, public 
agencies, and domain-specific firms. This allows broader development and diffusion of 
AI solutions, free from concerns about resource constraints or high entry barriers. 
14.36.	The scenario analysis presented in Box XIV.2 further reinforces the strategic 
relevance of this approach. With the simulations indicating that centralised AI compute 
expansion is exposed to hardware supply uncertainties, application-specific small 
models running on local hardware offer a more sustainable path forward. By enabling 
computation to occur locally, these models also facilitate secure deployment in sensitive 
sectors, such as public administration, healthcare, defence, and critical infrastructure. 
The decentralised compute paradigm enables AI capabilities to spread widely across 
sectors without requiring proportionate expansion in expensive, resource-intensive, 
and hardware-intensive data centres.
28	Although it is worth noting that frontier efforts currently underway will definitely result in the acquisition of 
valuable process knowledge that will ultimately trickle down into the bottom-up strategy.

Box XIV.3: Local Ingenuity and Frugal AI in India
India’s AI story is already evolving from the bottom-up. Local innovators, municipal bodies, 
start-ups, and community institutions are deploying AI to solve problems that are immediate 
and contextual to the communities they reside in. Applications are spread across a wide 
variety of sectors including health, agriculture, education, urban management, and disaster 
preparedness30.
In healthcare, AI is being used to expand access where traditional systems struggle to reach. 
In southern India, non-invasive AI-enabled thermal imaging tools are enabling early breast 
cancer screening in low-resource settings, reducing dependence on expensive diagnostic 
infrastructure and specialist availability. In eastern India, portable and low-cost AI-assisted 
oral cancer screening devices are bringing early detection to primary healthcare centres and 
outreach camps, directly addressing delays that often worsen outcomes. 
Urban and environmental challenges have similarly seen locally grounded solutions. In 
high-stress cities such as Bengaluru, AI-based water management systems are monitoring 
consumption and detecting leakages in real time. In the Himalayan region, indigenous sensor 
networks combined with machine learning models are providing real-time landslide alerts 
across vulnerable slopes. By offering advanced warnings at critical points, these systems are 
strengthening disaster preparedness in ecologically fragile areas. 
Deployment in agriculture and education further highlight the breadth of bottom-up 
adoption. AI-enabled agricultural networks have already improved market access, price 
discovery, and logistical efficiency for 1.8 million farmers across 12 states. At the municipal 
level, AI analytics are being utilised to monitor classroom learning outcomes, identify 
gaps early, and support more targeted interventions. Covering 18 classrooms across three 
schools in Pimpri-Chinchwad, the pilot has already produced material gains in terms of 
higher student engagement, improvement in teacher focus due to higher accountability, and 
enhanced supervisory capacity by school heads. 
Beyond sectoral applications, India’s approach to AI adoption also includes initiatives such 
as Bhashini, led by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and AI4Bharat 
at IIT Madras. These illustrate how language and voice-first AI systems can extend the reach 
of digital services to populations historically excluded from text-heavy and bandwidth-
intensive platforms. By enabling interaction in native languages and functioning effectively 
on low-cost devices, such frugal AI pathways align scale with inclusion.
These examples point to a distinctive Indian pathway for AI adoption: one that is decentralised, 
problem-driven, and embedded in local needs. Growing such applications in scale will 
require institutionalising these efforts under the National AI Mission. By systematically 
identifying successful bottom-up applications and encouraging experimentation, the 
Mission can help scale diverse AI-solutions by providing shared infrastructure, standards, 
governance frameworks and funding without diluting local creativity.

14.37.	 The strategy must encourage innovation on open-source and open-weight 
platforms, as shared innovation can enable India to achieve more with less. Open models 
have been closing the performance gap relative to closed models over the years, with 
the best open models approaching the frontier31. Additionally, India is currently one 
of the world’s largest and fastest-growing communities of open-source developers32. 
They are active contributors to global codebases, often working in collaborative 
environments. Therefore, unifying these efforts under the scope of the IndiaAI Mission 
is essential to steer the potential of our talent pool towards shared domestic innovation. 
Providing the nation’s talent a robust platform and policy guidance can help reduce 
India’s dependence on foreign proprietary systems, lower entry barriers for domestic 
developers, and create an environment that incentivises experimentation across sectors 
at a relatively low cost.

14.38.	For such a decentralised innovation ecosystem to translate into tangible 
outcomes, deliberate coordination is essential. Fragmentation in data availability and 
quality, standardisation, and ensuring interoperability across systems and datasets 
need to be addressed to provide an innovative, conducive environment. This is where 
public policy in a catalytic role becomes essential. The mission to coordinate a bottom-

up strategy can be spearheaded under an ‘AI-OS’ initiative, where the sovereign is a 
monetary shareholder in the effort, similar to UPI and Aadhaar, thereby turning AI 
into a public good. This will enable the sovereign to collaborate with state and local 
institutions to expand the availability of structured, anonymised, and machine-readable 
datasets in priority sectors; pool existing data centre capacity to create shared cloud 
compute infrastructure; and establish common platforms where open-source AI efforts 
can be coordinated and audited. 
14.39.	For instance, a centralised code repository, operating under the mandate of 
facilitating rapid experimentation, can jump-start India’s AI ambitions. A government-
hosted, community-curated platform under the IndiaAI mission umbrella would 
provide a secure and transparent space where developers, researchers, and enterprises 
can share code, contribute improvements, and build upon one another’s work. Much 
like how global platforms such as GitHub have become the backbone of software 
development, an India-specific repository would not only democratise access but also 
embed national priorities into the innovation process. 
14.40.	Equally important is encouraging greater private sector participation, 
particularly from large domestic firms with the capacity to absorb risk and scale 
successful applications. Promoting the indigenous development of sector-specific AI 
solutions has the added benefit of transforming India from the world’s ‘IT Sector back 
office’ to one of the ‘AI front offices.’ Our IT and IT-enabled services can and must move 
up the value chain, which in turn is necessary to create opportunities that retain high-
skill talent in the country. 
HUMAN CAPITAL FOR AI
14.41.	 Building models and applications, either fine-tuned or ground-up, capable 
of catering to local-level requirements needs two distinct skills, namely: algorithms 
and software engineering. India needs talent that understands the algorithmic issues 
involved in building models, along with an understanding of software engineering, 
to scale up and optimise models. This kind of knowledge is ‘underground knowledge’ 
that is not usually written down, and only those with hands-on experience of building 
models will understand these nuances. Accordingly, India must endeavour to attract 
people who have worked on large models and, in turn, have those with experience train 
others. 
14.42.	International experience33 suggests that such tacit capabilities are most effectively 
33	See for instance several initiatives undertaken by EU member countries (https://tinyurl.com/unasfshm) to 
foster greater industry-academia research collaborations or China’s Young Thousand Talents Program which has 
boosted domestic research productivity significantly (https://tinyurl.com/2hy7acrm).

sourced through a combination of diaspora return pathways, and industry-to-academia 
lateral entry. Countries that have successfully remained at the top of the innovation 
hierarchy over the years have complemented domestic skilling efforts with time-bound 
practitioner fellowships, flexible teaching roles for industry experts, and structured 
apprenticeship models embedded within real-world production environments. 
14.43.	Thus, to build talent that is in tune with industry needs, training must begin 
early, preferably at the high school or university level, in collaboration with the private 
sector. Universities must be free to curate and offer courses to students, as required 
by industry standards and in accordance with students' aptitudes. Flexibility is the key 
to building capable talent in India, and the introduction of the Viksit Bharat Shiksha 
Adhishthan Bill, 202534 , represents an essential first step in that direction. As the floor 
for what is considered a fundamental skill shifts with every technological revolution, 
the passage of the bill will afford our higher education system the freedom to keep pace 
with the evolving world. 
14.44.	Secondly, now is the time for policies to reevaluate what constitutes ‘formal 
education’ and what constitutes ‘work experience’. While the two were traditionally 
built under two mutually exclusive institutional setups, waiting until after graduation to 
build industry experience may no longer be feasible in a world where AI is outperforming 
entry-level, educated workers. For instance, some US-based firms have already begun 
offering fellowship programs to students right out of high school, aiming to channel 
talent into experience-building at a young age35.   
14.45.	Institutionalising such a system is necessary if India’s demographic dividend is 
to be nurtured into a competent workforce. One possible pathway to operationalising 
this is a ‘Earn-and-Learn’ initiative, where high-school, vocational, and early tertiary 
pathways are integrated into a structured, credit-bearing industry fellowship. This 
can be co-designed by the private sector and academic institutions, allowing practical 
experience training to begin as early as class 11. Students should be able to earn both 
academic credits and paid work experience through apprenticeships and project 
placements across various sectors, both of which contribute to their formal degrees. 
14.46.	With the National Education Policy 2020’s Multiple Entry Multiple Exit 
provisions, the Academic Bank of Credits, and the National Credit Framework, India 
has the policy infrastructure in place to make this vision real36. This new approach to 
education offers increased agency over learning to the students, allows institutions to

serve a more diverse range of learners, grants flexibility to faculty members, and can 
allow industry to collaborate with academia more deeply. 
14.47.	 The proposed approach aims to build on the Union Budget 2025-26 initiatives, 
supported by public seed funding and incentives for employers participating in 
structured earn-and-learn programs. This is complemented by the growing recognition 
of prior learning and short-form credentials that directly contribute to both higher 
education and job progression. Being able to toggle seamlessly between education and 
work experience is a necessity if the system is to produce well-rounded talent, not just 
for the AI sector, but for the country as a whole.

14.48.	 Similarly, reforms are also needed at the primary school level. As AI automates 
routine cognitive tasks, long-term talent utilisation will depend less on early technical 
specialisation and more on strong foundational skills. Primary education must prioritise core 
competencies such as literacy, numeracy, reasoning, problem-solving, communication and 
socio-emotional skills, alongside habits of curiosity and self-regulation. These capabilities 
form the base upon which later technical and vocational skills can be built. 
14.49.	Lastly, a comprehensive sectoral mapping of jobs outside the white-collar 
workspace, which have a high-skill requirement but are understaffed, needs to be 
undertaken. This is an often-overlooked source of new jobs within the economy. 
Surveying the geographic distribution of these jobs and the supporting infrastructure 
necessary to support and incentivise migration to the new job clusters will have to 
happen simultaneously. 

Evolution of the AI Ecosystem in India

14.50.	For instance, nursing and geriatric care are already understaffed, and the doubling 
of India’s dependency ratio in the next decade will create additional demand for skilled 
labour in this sector. Other tasks involving high-skill with long apprenticeship curves 
include culinary sciences, advanced metalwork, experiential hospitality designers, 
surgeons, physiotherapists, advanced electricians, early childhood educators, among 
many others. Sectors like these should be identified, and the education and skilling 
infrastructure must be upgraded to impart the necessary knowledge to fill the labour 
supply gaps. Opportunities in the physical, human-centric space and hands-on jobs 
hold immense potential for creating meaningful jobs in the coming decade. 
14.51.	 Recent empirical evidence from two centuries of technological change 
suggests that the labour market impacts of new technologies are neither uniform 
nor predetermined, but critically shaped by how skills, tasks, and institutions evolve 
together (Liu et al., 2025)37. While earlier waves of innovation tended to raise demand 
for higher-educated, cognitively specialised occupations emerging evidence indicates 
that AI may follow a different trajectory. It has the potential to increase demand for 
experience-intensive roles. 
14.52.	This underscores the importance of redesigning the education system in a 
way that does not rely solely on credit accumulation, but instead enables experiential 
learning, and the capability to adapt to a host of different occupations. In this context, 
the emphasis on early exposure to experience building, flexible education pathways, and 
strengthening foundational and human-centric skills becomes a necessary economic 
response to the distinctive labour-market dynamics that AI is likely to induce. 
Box XIV.4: Where human value lies in an AI-driven knowledge economy
Recent work by Restrepo (2025) advanced a grim view of the future of labour markets 
in which Artificial Intelligence progressively erodes the economic relevance of human 
cognitive labour. While this perspective usefully highlights the disruptive potential of a low 
probability, high-impact event, we advance an alternative and more likely trajectory. Rather 
than rendering cognitive workers redundant, AI may reshape where and how human value 
is created. As AI absorbs tasks related to retrieval and summarisation, the locus of human 
contribution shifts upward towards judgement, direction, expertise, and synthesis. AI is 
best understood as a powerful ship rather than an independent navigator: it can move faster 
and farther than any human, but without a knowledgeable captain who understands the 
vessel and the waters they are navigating, it is as likely to drift aimlessly as it is to arrive 
anywhere useful.

In this context, depth of domain knowledge becomes a binding constraint as AI can access 
vast troves of knowledge, but it lacks an internal sense of context or salience. Cognitive 
workers must therefore supply deep subject-matter understanding to frame the right 
questions, identify meaningful trade-offs, and evaluate outputs critically. Without such 
depth, AI-generated outputs converge on fluent but shallow consensus views. What will 
differentiate a competent employee from the crowd going forward will be their ability to 
know what to interrogate, what to discard, and where nuance changes outcomes.
Second, continuous reading and knowledge accumulation become core productivity inputs. 
Effective use of AI is not possible without frequent engagement with high-quality reading 
materials including research, data, institutional context, history, and competing perspectives. 
AI amplifies the returns to prior knowledge and users who read widely and deeply are better 
able to steer models and push analysis beyond surface-level synthesis. Those who do not 
will only tap into a fraction of the potential of AI and optimise for plausibility rather than 
understanding. In this sense, reading and learning is integral to day-to-day AI-enabled work. 
Third, cognitive workers must act as system architects rather than task executors. Productive 
AI use depends on the ability of the human to decompose complex problems, sequence 
inquiries, impose constraints, and define evaluation criteria. This is less about prompt 
engineering and more about structured thinking. Individuals who can translate ambiguous 
real-world objectives into coherent analytical frameworks will consistently outperform 
those who interact with AI in an unstructured, reactive manner. 
AI does not diminish the importance of cognitive workers, but rather it raises the threshold 
for what is considered meaningful contribution. For policymakers, this shift implies that 
skilling strategies must prioritise domain depth, analytical reasoning, structured problem-
solving, and continuous learning from an early age. The education system must produce 
individuals who are capable of sound judgement and have context-awareness. 
GOVERNANCE, INSTITUTIONAL ARCHITECTURE, AND 
DATA
Evolving Governance
14.53.	AI innovations and applications are rapidly outpacing regulatory developments, 
and the response required from policymakers must be measured and swift. Globally, 
several approaches to governing and regulating AI have been adopted, ranging from 
omnibus laws such as the ‘EU Artificial Intelligence Act’, to separate legislations

priorities, and reflect what we expect from AI in our economy. Regulatory design, 
whether mandatory or voluntary, must seek to integrate AI within the broader socio-
economic context of India, with special consideration for our labour market realities. 
The overarching goal for AI regulation must be to ensure that AI serves humanity, 
rather than supplants it.  
14.55.	 In this context, one of the most urgent responsibilities of an AI Economic Council 
(Box XIV.5) is to calibrate the pace of AI adoption within the country. India is a labour-
rich economy, and the unchecked replacement of the workforce by automation has 
destabilising effects. The institution must work closely with private sector firms to develop 
a roadmap for AI deployment over the next decade, outlining crucial details such as the 
profile of jobs affected, the geographies where displacement will be most concentrated, 
and the magnitude of jobs that will be both automated and augmented due to AI. 
14.56.	Such an exercise will help moderate the uncertainties surrounding the deployment 
of AI and inform the roadmap and design of policies required to mitigate the adverse 
effects of AI on the economy. The exercise also has the added benefit of informing 
policymakers on the necessary developments to reinforce our education system in a way 
that makes our students more capable in an AI-driven world. Furthermore, regulations 
need to evolve and necessitate transparency reporting requirements similar to those for 
social media, as well as product registrations, to help track the rate of deployment.
14.57.	 Policymakers must also manage where and how AI is deployed, as the manner 
in which AI is used will dictate the nature of the benefits accrued. For instance, AI 
in education holds a lot of potential, provided it is used as a supplementing tool for 
teachers and students. The widespread use of Generative AI by students as a substitute 
for creative and critical thinking ultimately does more harm than good in the long run. 
14.58.	The scale of the problem and the need for serious action to control AI use by 
students was also brought to light by Niall Ferguson in his recent article titled “AI’s 
great brain robbery.38”  The use of AI by students in universities is skyrocketing, and a 
significant portion of cognitive tasks is being offloaded to language models. Combined 
with the anxiety and depression inducing social media usage, students shirking the 
acquisition of skills such as sustained reading, critical thinking and analytical writing 
is only expected to make mental health issues much worse in the future. This will 
ultimately impact their productivity and their ability to contribute meaningfully to any 
work undertaken, perhaps even permanently denting their employment prospects.

14.59.	Two studies, independently examining the cognitive effects of Generative AI, 
arrive at similar conclusions (MIT39 , Microsoft40 ): dependence on AI for creative work 
and writing tasks is contributing to cognitive atrophy and a deterioration of critical 
thinking capabilities. The AI Economic Council must ensure that deployment of 
‘Artificial Intelligence’ does not come at the cost of ‘Human Intelligence’. 
14.60.	The examples presented above are not exhaustive, rather illustrative of the 
myriad challenges that policymakers will have to contend with as AI capabilities 
improve and applications proliferate. Given the many uncertainties that loom over the 
horizon, governance will remain a continuous process of monitoring, learning, and 
course correction. MeitY’s proposed AI Governance Group, along with the technical 
committee assisting the group, establishes a strong foundation on which India can 
develop a light, incentive-based and risk-weighted governance approach.
Box XIV.5: An AI Economic Council for India
The AI Economic Council, separate from the Governance Council, is intended to operate, not 
just with a technological imperative, but with moral imperatives that are sensitive to India’s 
socio-economic realities. They will operate as a coordinating authority that is responsible 
for aligning technology deployment with the evolution of India’s education and skilling 
infrastructure, while navigating resource constraints and developmental priorities. The core 
governance principles for such an institution would involve the following: 
1.	 Human Primacy and Economic Purpose: AI adoption must be explicitly 
subordinate to human welfare and economic inclusion. Every major AI deployment or 
policy proposal must demonstrate a credible pathway to net social and economic benefit, 
including employment, productivity diffusion, or public service quality. 
2.	 Labour-Market Sensitivity by Design: AI policy must internalise India’s labour 
structure: high informality, skill heterogeneity, regional variation, and limited safety 
nets. This would necessitate labour impact assessments ex ante, with mitigation and 
transition plans baked in. 
3.	 Sequencing over Speed: AI adoption should be phased in line with institutional 
readiness and skill pipelines. The institution may be empowered to classify AI uses into 
‘deploy now’, ‘pilot’ and ‘defer’ based on readiness across data, skills, legal frameworks, 
and labour adjustment capacity.

4.	 Co-evolution of Technology and Human Capital: Skill policy must stand equal 
to technology policy. AI push must proceed with parallel plans for educational reform, 
vocational adaptation, reskilling pathways and credential recognition. 
5.	 Public Interest Safeguards and Ethical Non-Negotiables: Ethical implications 
and boundaries must be clearly defined. Strict lines must be drawn around surveillance 
misuse, worker monitoring, algorithmic discrimination, and opaque decision making 
enabled by AI. 
These principles provide the overarching scope for the AI Economic Council. By embedding 
labour realities and social stability priorities into AI policy, the institution will ensure that 
AI advances productivity without eroding employment and the dignity of work. 
Data as a Strategic Resource: A Proposed Framework
Trusted Cross-Border Flows While Retaining Domestic Value
14.61.	 In the AI era, data is a core factor of production, which India needs to think 
about carefully if we are to develop a competitive edge in the sector. The country is 
already very digitally intensive, with over 100 crore people already having access to 
some form of wired or wireless broadband connectivity41. This represents a sizable 
potential market for AI and AI-based applications, as the barrier to accessing these 
services is, at present, extremely low. 
14.62.	Not only does this figure represent a large user base, but it also represents a 
significant source of data. India’s scale and diversity of domestically generated data 
constitute an important comparative advantage for anyone attempting to access 
the country’s market. However, the current landscape of globalised digital services, 
combined with the increasing concentration of AI development among a small number 
of multinational firms, has introduced new asymmetries in how value is created and 
captured from data. These developments necessitate a thorough evaluation of data 
governance frameworks, not with the intention of restricting data flows, but with the goal 
of ensuring accountability, fairness, and long-term domestic capability development. 
14.63.	India’s data governance approach thus far has deliberately avoided rigid data 
localisation mandates. This reflected a clear recognition of the productivity gains 
associated with cross-border data flows, the importance of regulatory predictability 
for spurring investments and India’s broader commitment to deregulation and ease 
of doing business. But certain aspects of this approach to governance will have to be 
expanded, as it is vital that India retain the value created from domestic data within the 
country.

Economic Survey 2025-26

14.64.	Additionally, given that the current stock of training data is soon expected to 
run out42  and models collapse when trained on synthetic data43, firms will be on the 
lookout for new sources of human-generated data that are not accessible through 
online scraping alone. Policy must remain cognizant of the potential value embedded 
in India’s data. 
14.65.	The challenge, therefore, lies in reconciling openness with control, and global 
integration with domestic economic interests. Framing this challenge purely in terms 
of data localisation risks oversimplifying a complex trade-off and imposing costs that 
may ultimately undermine innovation. A more durable approach lies in shifting the 
emphasis from territorial immobility of data toward enforceable accountability and 
economic alignment, as the framework presented below demonstrates.
Objectives and Spirit 
14.66.	The proposed framework for evolving India’s data governance approach is rooted 
in three interlinked objectives:
a.	 To preserve India’s openness to cross-border data flows, recognising their 
importance for innovation and investment;
b.	 To ensure regulatory oversight and enforceability over large-scale processing 
and use of Indian personal data, irrespective of where the processing occurs, 
and
c.	 To promote domestic value retention, such that Indian data contributes 
meaningfully to the development of India’s own AI capabilities and research 
ecosystem.
14.67.	 Under this approach, cross-border data transfers are accompanied by 
obligations that preserve regulatory visibility and intervention capacity. Entities that 
process Indian personal data at scale, particularly for high-impact AI applications 
such as general-purpose model training, are expected to ensure that such data remains 
auditable, retrievable, and subject to the oversight of Indian regulatory authorities. This 
is achieved not by mandating that all processing occur domestically, but by requiring 
technical and contractual arrangements that allow regulators to trace data provenance, 
examine downstream uses, and, where necessary, order corrective measures such as 
deletion, retraining, or suspension of use.

Evolution of the AI Ecosystem in India
577
577
14.68.	To begin with, India would have to build on the foundations of the provisions 
of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, and expand how data is 
categorised. Precise and functional data categorisation allows governance to be targeted 
without becoming indiscriminate. Rather than treating all data as homogeneous, our 
regulations must evolve to incorporate distinctions between different categories of data 
based on sensitivity and economic use. 
14.69.	In particular, a separate treatment is warranted for large-scale behavioural, 
transactional, and inferred datasets. These sets, while not always sensitive in isolation, 
acquire strategic and economic significance when aggregated and deployed for AI 
training. The ability to designate categories through subordinate legislation or rules 
enables India’s regulatory framework to remain adaptive as applications evolve, without 
requiring frequent statutory amendments. 
14.70.	Data categorisation serves as the basis for graduated obligations, enabling 
heightened accountability and value-retention requirements to apply only where the 
risks and asymmetries are more pronounced. Lower-risk categories can continue to 
move freely with minimal compliance requirements, while higher-impact categories will 
necessitate a higher degree of transparency, auditability, and contribution expectations. 
This will help align India’s data governance standards with its broader efforts to shift 
towards risk-based regulations across sectors. Governance will remain concentrated 
only where it delivers the greatest public value. 
Incentivising Localisation
14.71.	 A key operational element of the proposed approach is the requirement for 
eligible entities to maintain a contemporaneous mirrored copy of relevant datasets and 
derived artefacts within India. This ensures that regulatory oversight does not become 
ineffective merely because processing occurs offshore. At the same time, it avoids 
the rigidity and economic costs associated with compulsory in-country processing, 
particularly for firms operating global AI pipelines. In this sense, sovereignty is exercised 
not through physical containment, but through enforceable rights and institutional 
capacity.
14.72.	 Recognising the heterogeneity of actors within the digital economy, the proposed 
evolution of the framework adopts a risk-weighted and proportionate structure. 
Obligations scale with the size, scope, sensitivity and economic impact of data use rather 
than being applied uniformly across all firms. Enhanced requirements are triggered 
only when data processing reaches thresholds associated with systemic relevance, 
such as large numbers of Indian data principals, use in training general-purpose or 
foundation models, significant revenue generation from Indian data-driven services, 

Economic Survey 2025-26
578
578
or reliance on public-sector or regulated datasets. Smaller firms, start-ups, firms 
focused on developing sovereign models or indigenously developed AI applications, 
and research institutions remain subject to a lighter compliance regime, ensuring that 
regulatory attention is focused where risks and asymmetries are most pronounced.
14.73.	 Beyond regulatory oversight, the framework is meant to address a second, 
equally important concern: the retention of economic value derived from Indian data. 
Data governance that focuses solely on movement restrictions risks missing the larger 
issue of value capture. Accordingly, the framework emphasises incentive-compatible 
mechanisms that align private incentives with public objectives. Firms that derive 
substantial commercial value from Indian datasets are expected to contribute to the 
domestic AI ecosystem, but are afforded flexibility in how they do so. 
14.74.	 Contributions may take the form of:
a.	 Local training or fine-tuning of models for applications intended to address 
sector-specific or region-specific issues across the country;
b.	 Making transparent, proportionate financial contributions for the purpose of 
furthering domestic AI research and development linked to revenues generated 
from Indian-data-derived services;
c.	 Contributing datasets, compute resources, or funding to certified public data 
trusts that support research and innovation; 
d.	 Establishing or supporting AI research labs, skilling initiatives, aiding 
universities with course development, or joint programs with firms based in 
India. 
14.75.	 Once again, the list of examples is not exhaustive, but rather indicative of the 
broader context. The principle here is to avoid coercion while ensuring that value 
extraction is accompanied by value creation in India. This menu-based compliance 
approach allows firms to retain flexibility while the domestic ecosystem benefits from 
capital, infrastructure access, talent utilisation and knowledge spillovers. 
Regulating AI Firms
14.76.	 In regulating AI firms, the framework prioritises accountability. Attempting 
to govern AI by controlling the physical location of model parameters is increasingly 
impractical in an environment characterised by distributed training, rapid cross-country 
iterations and modular deployment. Instead, emphasis is placed on transparency and 
responsible use. 

Evolution of the AI Ecosystem in India
579
579
14.77.	 Covered entities must be required to maintain clear records of dataset 
provenance, publish standardised model documentation describing training inputs 
and limitations, undertake impact assessments for high-risk deployments, publish said 
assessments for public review, and implement post-deployment monitoring and harm 
reporting mechanisms. Restrictions on exporting model weights derived from Indian 
data are reserved for narrowly defined, high-risk categories where demonstrable harms 
may arise. This helps retain the ability to intervene only when necessary. 
14.78.	Consistent with the Government’s deregulatory orientation, the framework 
relies heavily on positive incentives rather than prescriptive mandates. Firms that 
choose to operate within certified domestic compute or data environments benefit 
from reduced audit burdens, faster regulatory clearances, and preferential access to 
national AI programmes. Participation in such environments remains voluntary but 
is commercially attractive, encouraging the organic development of India’s AI and 
computing infrastructure over time.
14.79.	 Finally, the framework recognises that the State’s most effective lever lies in access. 
Compliance with accountability and value-retention obligations is therefore linked to 
eligibility for government datasets, participation in national AI missions and regulatory 
sandboxes, and access to public-sector procurement opportunities. This approach allows 
the State to shape incentives without expanding the statutory footprint of regulation.
14.80.	To sum up, this proposed framework represents a pragmatic evolution in India’s 
data governance approach. It preserves openness to global data flows while ensuring 
that Indian data remains subject to adequate oversight and contributes meaningfully to 
domestic economic capacity. By shifting the focus from rigid localisation to accountable 
portability and value retention, the framework aligns with India’s broader reform 
trajectory. It is intended to help position the country as an active participant in the 
global AI economy. 
Box XIV.6: Data as a Strategic Resource — Objectives and  
Framework Principles
Objectives
The proposed data governance framework for the AI era is guided by three core objectives:
1.	 Preserve openness to cross-border data flows, recognising their importance for 
signalling policy certainty, incentivising innovation, encouraging investment and 
continued global integration. 
2.	 Ensure regulatory oversight and enforceability over large-scale processing and 
use of Indian personal data.

Economic Survey 2025-26

3.	 Promote domestic value retention, so that Indian data contributes meaningfully to 
India’s AI capabilities and long-term technological resilience. 
Core Framework Principles
•	
Accountable Portability over Rigid Localisation: Data may move across borders, 
but entities processing Indian data at scale must ensure auditability and traceability. 
•	
Risk-Based Data Categorisation: Data is classified by sensitivity and economic 
significance. Large-scale behavioural, transactional, personal, and inferred datasets 
receive differentiated treatment due to their strategic value for AI training. 
•	
Graduated Obligations: Regulatory requirements scale with risk and size. Higher-
impact uses such as general-purpose model training or large-scale monetisation will 
require enhanced transparency and accountability obligations. Start-ups and research 
institutions will have eased compliance requirements. 
•	
Mirrored Data for Oversight: Eligible entities maintain contemporaneous mirrored 
copies of relevant datasets and derived artefacts within India to ensure effective 
supervision. No mandates are proposed for domestic processing.
•	
Incentive-Compatible Value Retention: Firms extracting significant commercial 
value from Indian data are expected to contribute to the domestic AI ecosystem through 
flexible, menu-based mechanisms, such as local model training, financial contributions 
to AI R&D, data or compute sharing, or investments in research, skilling, and institutional 
development.
•	
Transparency-Centred AI Regulation: Governance focuses on dataset provenance, 
standardised model documentation, impact assessments for high-risk uses, and post-
deployment monitoring, rather than attempting to control model location or architecture.
•	
Positive Incentives over Prescriptive Mandates: Participation in certified 
domestic compute or data environments is voluntary but rewarded through reduced 
audit burdens and faster clearances.
•	
Access as the State’s Primary Lever: Compliance is linked to eligibility for 
government datasets, AI missions, regulatory sandboxes, and public procurement, 
allowing the State to shape incentives without expanding statutory controls.
AI SAFETY AND RISKS
14.81.	 Lastly, and most importantly, is the necessity for India to push the envelope in 
managing the risks associated with the proliferation of AI44. As with nuclear energy or 
pharmaceuticals, where the promise of progress coexists with the possibility of harm, 
44	Yoshua Bengio has spoken extensively about the need for independent institutions aimed at evaluating AI Safety. 
His recent talk (https://tinyurl.com/y79fetya) sheds light on the seriousness of the topic at hand and his non-
profit LawZero is dedicated to the cause of safe AI development (https://lawzero.org/en).

Evolution of the AI Ecosystem in India

AI must be treated as a general-purpose technology whose capabilities necessitate 
not only enabling institutions but also constraining ones. The MeitY Governance 
Guidelines capture this essence and propose an AI Safety Institute, which will perform 
several key functions, including the analysis of emerging risks, potential regulatory 
gaps, coordination on AI safety issues, and conducting training programmes to build 
awareness, among others.
14.82.	The path forward now must further develop these foundations, with chief among 
the priorities being the enhancement of transparency. Safety evaluations conducted in 
an ongoing and anticipatory manner will help safeguard public interest and foster trust 
in emerging technologies. Making these evaluation results public must emerge as a non-
negotiable condition, as a significant information gap exists between the companies 
developing AI models and the end-users of these models. Assessments by AI Lab 
Watch, an independent organisation dedicated to the cause of AI safety, demonstrate 
that while big-tech firms speak about the ‘safety evaluations’ they conduct, the work 
undertaken to perform said analysis is far from ideal45.  
14.83.	 AI Lab Watch demonstrates that big-tech firms obfuscate how they go about 
their evaluations, hide their reasoning and provide dubious interpretations of their 
evaluation results. Secondly, based on the risks the companies claim to have evaluated, 
they claim to have implemented safeguards to mitigate them, but no evidence has been 
made available to the public. As models become increasingly capable in the future, the 
need for a sovereign AI safety institute to take on a larger role becomes even more 
pressing, ensuring transparency and guiding informed decisions on AI adoption, both 
for the public good and for private sector considerations. 
14.84.	Another case for the safety institute expanding its scope lies in the application 
of AI, for instance, the convergence of AI with synthetic biology. Open-source CRISPR46 
kits are now widely accessible to hobbyist researchers, biohackers and DIY (Do-It-
Yourself ) scientists. By itself, the risk of bio-weapon development remains low due 
to these kits. However, by combining the accessibility of these kits with advanced AI 
models capable of generating genomic sequences and guiding gene-editing protocols, 
the threat landscape changes dramatically. A motivated individual with sufficient 
computing access and no formal training could, in principle, engineer pathogens with 
malicious intent. The bar for misuse is no longer determined by scientific expertise, as 
AI-driven tools significantly lower the barrier to entry. 
45	AI Lab Watch. https://aisafetyclaims.org/. 
46	CRISPR, short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, is a gene-editing technology that 
has transformed molecular biology and medicine. It's a tool that allows scientists to precisely target and modify 
DNA sequences in living organisms, with applications ranging from basic research to potential treatments for 
genetic diseases. CRISPR kits are widely available at very low costs and are easy to get hold of for use by anyone 
interested in gene-editing.

Economic Survey 2025-26
582
582
14.85.	Evidence by Cheng et al. (2025)47 also suggests that AI risks need not only arise 
from misuse or frontier capabilities, but can emerge endogenously from how models 
are optimised and deployed. Widely deployed models have demonstrated a tendency 
to exhibit ‘social sycophancy’, over-affirming users’ actions and viewpoints at rates 
significantly higher than human benchmarks. This has persisted even in contexts 
involving interpersonal harm or unethical behaviour. Crucially, the study found that 
such behaviour increases user trust and reliance on AI systems, while simultaneously 
reducing users’ willingness to engage in corrective or prosocial actions. This creates a 
perverse incentive structure where models that are behaviourally risky are also more 
likely to be preferred and reinforced, as it helps with user retention. 
14.86.	It is precisely in such high-stakes circumstances that periodic, scenario-based 
testing and red-teaming48 of AI models must become institutionalised. However, 
India does not have to do this in isolation. There is a strategic case for international 
cooperation, particularly with established sovereign safety institutes, such as the 
United Kingdom’s AI Security Institute49. They have developed templates for model 
evaluations, misuse testing protocols, and interpretability analysis that offer a valuable 
foundation. Similarly, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the United 
States has developed an AI Risk Management Framework50 that defines guidelines for 
incorporating trustworthiness considerations into the design, development, use, and 
evaluation of AI products, services, and systems.
14.87.	A bilateral or multilateral partnership between India’s proposed safety institute 
and counterparts such as the UK or the US could enable joint evaluations of high-risk 
models and shared access to computing infrastructure. This would not only improve 
scientific credibility but also reduce redundancy and enhance global interoperability of 
AI safety standards. 
14.88.	Another domain where the safety institute must be quick to establish rules is 
in defining strict boundaries within the confines of which AI must be developed and 
applied. There are various applications of AI where its restrictions can be considered 
non-negotiable, such as predictive policing, facial recognition, exploiting psychological 
vulnerabilities, inferring emotions, and evaluating and classifying individuals or groups 
47	Cheng, M., Lee, C., Khadpe, P., Yu, S., Han, D., & Jurafsky, D. (2025). Sycophantic AI decreases prosocial 
intentions and promotes dependence. arXiv preprint arXiv:2510.01395.
48	Red-teaming refers to the practice of deliberately trying to break or misuse a system within a controlled 
environment. It seeks to stress-test models, simulating worst case scenarios such as malicious use, biased 
behaviour, or unexpected failure. The process helps identify risks and blind spots that may have been missed 
during the course of the model’s development, or discover emergent behaviour which may have unintended 
consequences.

based on their behavioural or personality traits, among others. These applications are 
likely to lead to adverse outcomes, regardless of whether they are used in the private 
sector or the public sector. No conception of safe or human-centric AI is credible without 
placing the protection of individual rights at its core.  
14.89.	In the context of safety, the recommendations from a study by Narayanan and 
Kapoor (2025) are also highly appropriate and must be taken into consideration51. 
The safety institution must work closely with the governance body to devise robust 
whistle-blower protections, as only insiders will have knowledge of potentially 
hazardous applications that can be brought to light. Developing strategies to address 
the uncertainties and risks associated with AI development, while also making the 
domain more transparent to the public, must always remain a core responsibility of the 
government. 
A PHASED ROADMAP FOR INDIA’S AI FUTURE
Sequencing India’s AI Policy: A Phased Roadmap
14.90.	India’s AI strategy must be sequenced carefully to avoid premature lock-ins or 
regulatory overreach. The objective is to build coordination first, capacity next, and 
binding policy leverage last, allowing institutions and markets to co-evolve. 
14.91.	 The first phase should focus on operationalising already announced institutions 
and aligning incentives to enable experimentation. Policy should enable bottom-up 
innovation by expanding the reach of the existing shared infrastructure under the IndiaAI 
Mission. This includes a government-hosted community-curated code repository and 
pooled access to public datasets, facilitated by initiatives already underway to enable 
shared access to computing infrastructure. A clear focus on application- or sector-
specific, small and open-weight models will enable efficient resource utilisation. 
14.92.	Data governance must also evolve through subordinate legislation under 
the DPDP framework to introduce functional data categorisation and auditability 
requirements, specifically for large-scale AI training. This must be complemented by 
incentive-based mechanisms for domestic value retention, such as the menu-based 
contribution pathways illustrated earlier. Human capital pipelines, particularly the 
‘earn-and-learn’ pathways and curricular flexibility, should be scaled using existing 
legislative and budgetary levers. 
14.93.	Once coordination mechanisms are functional and early experimentation has

generated evidence, policy can shift toward selective scaling in the medium-term. 
Shared and certified domestic computing infrastructure should expand, with voluntary 
participation by large and resourceful firms linked to regulatory facilitation and access 
to public datasets. At the same time, AI regulation should be formalised on a risk-based 
and proportionate basis. 
14.94.	Graduated obligations for AI firms should be codified according to scale and 
sector of use. Oversight must be embedded within existing sectoral regulators rather 
than through a single omnibus AI law. The AI Safety Institute’s role should deepen from 
analysis to structured scenario testing, red-teaming, and international cooperation, 
with clearly articulated non-negotiable boundaries for high-risk applications. 
14.95.	Our long-term goals must encompass two main objectives. First, India’s 
focus should shift towards resilience. Access to advanced computing hardware will 
require strategic partnerships and diplomacy. The objective must be to reduce India’s 
vulnerability to external shocks. Second, sustained adaptation of labour markets and 
education systems will be essential. Primary education must prioritise foundational 
cognitive and socio-emotional skills, while skilling systems must align themselves with 
both AI- and human-centric sectoral requirements. 
Conclusion
14.96.	Artificial Intelligence does not confront India with a single policy question, but 
a series of choices that must be made under conditions of heightened uncertainty and 
resource constraints. This chapter has argued that the central challenge for India is in 
what it builds domestically, what it sources globally, what it regulates early, and what it 
deliberately allows to evolve. The contours of the global AI ecosystem make clear that 
passive consumption is the riskiest position of all. 
14.97.	 India’s position as a relatively late mover in the AI transition also confers an 
underappreciated advantage. Early adopters who scaled AI under conditions of a 
regulatory vacuum and cheap capital have now locked themselves into circumstances 
that are very difficult to back away from. This includes a commitment to energy-
intensive architectures that are detrimental to the environment and mounting financial 
commitments with unclear revenue pathways. With the sums of money involved, 
discussions surrounding government backstops have emerged as possible insurance 
against a fallout, in the advanced economies. 
14.98.	India has the benefit of hindsight. It can learn from these practices and avoid 
dependencies that are difficult to unwind. This allows India to design AI systems that are 
more resource-efficient and aligned with public objectives from the outset, sequencing

regulation alongside deployment. In this sense, late adoption need not imply lagging 
ambition. Properly leveraged, it offers the country the opportunity to pursue a more 
resilient and inclusive AI trajectory. 
14.99.	India’s comparative advantage in the AI era does not lie in replicating frontier-
scale model development, although valuable process knowledge can be gained from 
the current efforts already underway. The country’s strengths lie in application-led 
innovation, the productive use of domestic data, human capital depth, and the ability 
of public institutions to coordinate distributed efforts. A bottom-up strategy anchored
