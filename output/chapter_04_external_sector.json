    "This page has been left blank",
    "India’s external sector has evolved amidst a global environment characterised by heightened trade policy uncertainty, geopolitical realignments, and a structural shift away from a hyper-globalisation phase. The reconfiguration of global trade and investment flows, increasingly influenced by considerations of national security, technological sovereignty, and strategic autonomy, has introduced both new constraints and opportunities for emerging economies. In this changing environment, India’s external performance demonstrates resilience to global shocks and highlights the structural characteristics associated with a rapidly growing economy that is integrating more deeply into global markets.",
    "On the trade front, India’s total exports reached record levels of USD 825.3 billion in FY25 and USD 418.5 billion in H1 FY26, driven by strong growth in services exports and sustained momentum in non-petroleum, non-gems, and jewellery exports. The expansion of higher-value manufacturing exports, especially in electronics, pharmaceuticals, and electrical machinery, along with diversification of export destinations and import sources, has strengthened resilience amid rising protectionism and tariff uncertainties. The services trade surplus remains a key stabilising factor, consistently offsetting a large portion of the merchandise trade deficit, supported by strong growth in software, business services, and the expanding role of Global Capability Centres.",
    "India’s current account remains stable, buoyed by robust inflows from services exports and remittances. On the capital account, India has attracted significant gross investment inflows despite a subdued global environment for foreign direct investment (FDI) and volatile portfolio flows. Gross FDI inflows have remained resilient, supported by equity investments and greenfield projects, while portfolio flows have been volatile, reflecting global financial conditions.",
    "External buffers have further strengthened, with foreign exchange reserves providing comfortable import cover and robust protection against external liabilities. India’s international investment position has steadily improved, and its external debt remains moderate, with a favourable maturity profile and high reserve coverage."

Foreign policy similarity is measured as the average similarity in the voting record of each country pair, corrected for the fact that non-alliance ties are more frequent than alliance ties.
