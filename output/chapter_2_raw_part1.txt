FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS: 
ANCHORING STABILITY 
THROUGH CREDIBLE 
CONSOLIDATION
At a time when public debt remains elevated globally, and fiscal space is under 
strain across countries, the Central Government’s fiscal trajectory stands out for 
combining consolidation with sustained public investment. The government’s 
calibrated fiscal strategy, anchored in credible deficit reduction, resilient 
revenue mobilisation, and a decisive reorientation of spending toward capital 
formation, has strengthened macroeconomic stability and supported growth 
in the post-pandemic period. Importantly, this fiscal resilience reflects prudent 
fiscal policy choices and careful fiscal management.
The Centre’s revenue receipts strengthened significantly, rising from an average 
of about 8.5 per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period (FY16-FY20) to around 
9.1 per cent in the post-pandemic years (FY22-FY25). This improvement was 
driven primarily by buoyant direct tax collections, supported by tax reforms, 
technology-enabled compliance, deeper formalisation, and improved corporate 
profitability. Among indirect taxes, GST collections have recorded multiple 
all-time highs in absolute terms during FY26, with growth broadly aligned to 
nominal GDP. The recent GST rate rationalisation reforms are expected to support 
demand by lowering tax incidence and improving price competitiveness, with 
volume and compliance effects helping to maintain revenue resilience. High-
frequency indicators, such as e-way bill generation, PMI readings, automobile 
sales, UPI transactions, and tractor sales, point to strengthening economic 
momentum in the recent months following these reforms.
On the expenditure side, consolidation has been achieved alongside an 
improvement in expenditure quality. Revenue expenditure moderated from 13.6 
per cent of GDP in FY22 to 10.9 per cent in FY25, creating space for productive 
capital outlays. Capital expenditure was scaled up from an average of 1.7 per 
cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period to approximately 3 per cent in the years 
following the pandemic, with effective capital expenditure reaching 4 per cent of 
GDP in FY25. This rebalancing was supported by subsidy rationalisation reduced 
leakages from Direct Benefit Transfers, and other public financial management 
reforms, such as Just-in-Time fund releases. As a result, fiscal indicators remain 
on track in FY26, indicating adherence to the budgeted consolidation path. 
The Central Government, through its Special Assistance to States for Capital

Expenditure/Investment (SASCI), has successfully incentivised the States to 
maintain capital expenditure at around 2.4 per cent of GDP in FY25. Further, 
the emerging fiscal trade-offs at the State level, particularly the rapid expansion 
of unconditional cash transfers, have been highlighted. While these provide 
immediate income support, their growing scale risks increasing expenditure 
rigidity and crowding out resources for capital investments, including human- 
capital.
Finally, the chapter demonstrates that, unlike many peer economies where 
post-pandemic debt unwinding has been limited, India has reduced its general 
government debt-to-GDP ratio by approximately 7.1 percentage points since 
2020, while sustaining high public investment. Going forward, the Central 
Government’s credible medium-term goal to converge towards a debt-to-GDP 
ratio of 50 ± 1 per cent provides the policy anchor for sustaining this consolidation 
at the general government level as well.
The chapter also offers certain reform suggestions for reducing cross-subsidies, 
stabilising the pipeline for equity monetisation by revising the definition of 
government companies, advancing the trust and nudge theory in e-way billing, 
and reaping efficiencies in spending. 
INTRODUCTION
2.1	 A key development for the Indian economy in 2025 was the recognition of its fiscal 
resilience by global rating agencies, reflected in three sovereign credit rating upgrades 
by Morningstar DBRS, S&P Global Ratings, and Rating and Investment Information, 
Inc. (R&I). These upgrades were attributed to India’s prudent fiscal management 
supported by continued deficit reduction, improved revenue buoyancy, and a clear shift 
in public spending toward growth-enhancing capital investment. Rating agencies also 
highlighted improved fiscal transparency and a credible medium-term consolidation 
path as factors that strengthen debt dynamics and reinforce confidence in India’s 
macroeconomic and fiscal framework.
2.2	 It is noteworthy that this fiscal resilience has been the outcome of deliberate 
and sustained policy effort rather than a natural and easy progression. At a time of 
elevated expenditure pressures and uncertainty around revenue streams, articulating a 
medium-term consolidation path and adhering to it required strong policy commitment. 
This chapter examines the fiscal policy choices made over the recent years that have 
strengthened the fiscal capacity of the Central Government while also encouraging 
healthier fiscal practices among the States. It begins with an assessment of the fiscal 
performance of the Centre and the States, followed by an analysis of government debt 
and the consolidated general government position, and concludes with an assessment 
of the fiscal outlook.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES
Fiscal policy as a key anchor of macroeconomic stability and confidence
2.3	 A predictable and credible fiscal trajectory by the Centre over the past years has 
anchored overall macroeconomic stability by balancing growth imperatives with fiscal 
sustainability. The Central government’s fiscal consolidation experience underscores 
the value of clearly defined fiscal targets alongside retained flexibility, thereby allowing 
fiscal policy to support rather than constrain growth during periods of uncertainty. In 
this context, the Union Budget for FY22 articulated a medium-term glide path, targeting 
a fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26, instead of binding annual targets, to 
ensure that growth-enhancing expenditure, particularly capex, was not compromised.
2.4	 Accordingly, the fiscal deficit declined from 9.2 per cent of GDP in FY21 to 4.8 
per cent of GDP in FY25 [Provisional Accounts, (PA)] and is budgeted at 4.4 per cent 
of GDP in FY26 (Chart II.1). Over the same period, the revenue deficit as a proportion 
of GDP has narrowed steadily, reaching its lowest level since FY09, thereby leaving 
a greater allocation for capex (Chart II.2) and reflecting a sustained improvement in 
the quality of expenditure. The decline in the primary deficit-to-GDP ratio1 during this 
period (Chart II.1), further indicates that fresh borrowings are now increasingly being 
used to service past interest obligations rather than to finance current spending.

Sustained revenue buoyancy supports consolidation
2.5	 In an environment of heightened global volatility, government revenues have 
strengthened fiscal capacity, allowing expenditure needs to be met while following a 
consolidation path. An assessment of the Central Government’s receipts, comprising 
revenue receipts (net tax to Centre and non-tax revenues) and non-debt capital receipts, 
provides insight into the sources of this resilience.
2.6	 Revenue receipts increased from an average of about 8.5 per cent of GDP during the 
pre-pandemic period (FY16-FY20) to around 9.1 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic 
period (FY22-FY25 PA).3 This improvement was driven primarily by higher gross tax 
revenue, which rose from an average of 10.8 per cent of GDP to about 11.5 per cent of 
GDP over the same period. The buoyancy of revenues reflects both the strong growth 
momentum of the domestic economy and the cumulative impact of tax policy and tax 
administration reforms implemented by the Government. Within the overall stable tax 
revenues, the performance of individual tax components reveals notable shifts in the 
composition and sources of revenue growth.
Broadening of the Direct Tax Base
2.7	 The share of direct taxes in total taxes4 has increased in the past years, from 51.9 per 
cent in the pre-pandemic period to 55.5 per cent in the post-pandemic years, reaching 
58.8 per cent in FY25(PA). Table II.1 shows the trends in the components of direct taxes. 
Among these, the non-corporate tax collections5 have recorded a strong performance, 
with collections increasing from an average of about 2.4 per cent of GDP in the pre-
pandemic period to around 3.3 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic period. Even 
within the post-pandemic years, these collections rose from 3 per cent of GDP in FY22 
to about 3.7 per cent of GDP in FY25(PA). This momentum is also reflected in the strong 
average buoyancy6 of 1.8 observed in non-corporate taxes during FY23 to FY25(PA)7 , 
implying that collections grew faster than nominal GDP.
3	 Throughout the chapter FY16-FY20 is taken as pre-pandemic period, and FY22-FY25 is taken as the post-
pandemic period.
4	 Share of major direct taxes (i.e., Corporate tax + Taxes on income other than Corporate tax) in the total of major 
direct and indirect taxes (i.e, Corporate tax+ Taxes on income other than Corporate tax + Customs+ Excise+ GST 
+ Service tax).
5 Taxes on income other than Corporation tax, as reported in the Budget are being termed as Non-corporate tax 
in the chapter. This includes personal income tax collections, various cesses and surcharges, as well as securities 
transaction tax (STT).
6	 Tax buoyancy measures how responsive tax revenues are to changes in overall economic activity, typically GDP. It 
is measured as follows: Tax Buoyancy = per cent change in tax revenue (non-adjusted for policy or rate changes) 
÷ per cent change in GDP. Buoyancy value >1 implies that Tax revenue grows faster than GDP.
7	 Since the data in post post-pandemic period is taken for FY22-FY25, the growth rates/buoyancies during the 
period are reported for FY23-FY25 (Growth in FY22 was distorted due to a low base in FY21).

2.8	 This improvement has been supported by a steady expansion of the tax base. The 
number of income tax returns filed increased in the post-pandemic period, from 6.9 
crore in FY22 to 9.2 crore in FY258, reflecting gains from improved compliance, wider 
use of technology in tax administration, and a growing number of individuals entering 
the tax net as their incomes rise. Nudge-based interventions have emerged as a powerful 
tool for improving tax compliance and enhancing the efficiency of tax administration in 
India (See Box II.1).
Box II.1: Nudging Compliance: How Data-Driven Behavioural Interventions 
Transformed Tax Collection Efficiency in India
Anchored in behavioural economics, the NUDGE (Non-intrusive Usage of Data to Guide and 
Enable) approach adopted by the Income Tax Department, focuses on influencing taxpayer 
behaviour through timely information, gentle prompts, and data-driven insights rather 
than coercive enforcement. At its core, the NUDGE framework leverages large-scale data 
analytics to identify potential non-compliance, guide taxpayers with relevant information, 
and empower them to voluntarily correct or update their filings, without resorting to audits 
or litigation.  
For instance, the Foreign Asset Campaign prompted nearly 25,000 taxpayers to revise 
their returns, with over 61 per cent responding positively to nudges. This resulted in the 
declaration of foreign assets worth over ₹29,000 crore and foreign income exceeding 
₹1,000 crore, a significant portion of which was through belated returns. Similarly, nudges 
related to deductions under Section 80GGC led to a large-scale correction of claims, with 
over 91,000 taxpayers filing updated returns, a reduction of excessive deductions by nearly 
₹2,050 crore, and additional tax payments of over ₹680 crore. Similarly, targeted nudges 
led to a reduction in incorrect House Rent Allowance (HRA) claims, resulting in additional 
tax collections of over ₹119 crore.

Data-driven nudges also improved third-party reporting and accuracy in TDS filings. More 
than 8,500 deductors revised their TDS returns, adding over 1.08 crore deductees and 
bringing additional TDS of nearly ₹4,825 crore into the system. The tool also helped to 
identify non-genuine agricultural income of ₹2,038.02 crore from 310 entities and capital 
gains of ₹33,057.28 crore earned through Offer for Sale (OFS) by promoters during Initial 
Public Offers. 
Overall, the NUDGE initiative has improved tax collection efficiency by shifting the focus 
from post-facto enforcement to preventive, technology-enabled compliance. It has reduced 
friction, litigation, and compliance costs for both taxpayers and the administration, while 
increasing revenue through voluntary means. By combining data, behavioural insights, 
and transparent communication, nudge-based tax administration represents a modern, 
efficient, and citizen-centric approach to revenue mobilisation.
2.9	 Corporate tax collections also recorded an average buoyancy close to unity during FY23-
FY25, broadly in line with nominal GDP growth. This reflects the resilience and recovery of the 
private corporate sector in the post-pandemic period. According to the Reserve Bank of India, 
aggregate corporate profits of listed companies have increased from around ₹2.5 trillion in 
FY21 to ₹7.1 trillion in FY25, resulting in a more than 100 per cent increase in corporate tax 
collections over this period.9
2.10	During the current fiscal year, the major direct taxes10 reached nearly 53 per cent 
of the Budget estimates as of November 2025, as against 56.6 per cent during the 
corresponding period of the previous year. Personal income tax collections grew by 
6.8 per cent YoY, and corporation tax collections increased by 7.8 per cent YoY during 
the period, reflecting the various tax concessions granted during this time. The Union 
Budget 2025-26 ushered in significant income-tax relief for the middle class, with 
no personal income tax payable for income11 upto ₹12 lakh (₹12.75 lakh for salaried 
taxpayers) alongside changes in slabs and rates as well as in TDS rules. The new Income 
Tax Act, 2025, which focuses on simplification, structural clarity, and continuity of tax 
policy, was enacted on August 21, 2025, and is slated to take effect from the tax year 
2026-27.
Excise and Customs Duties: Supporting growth through rate 
rationalisation
2.11	 Among major indirect taxes, excise duty collections moderated in the post-
pandemic period, declining from about 1.7 per cent of GDP in FY22 to around 0.9 per 
cent of GDP in FY25. This moderation was driven by reductions in excise duty rates on 
petroleum products in 2021 and 2022, along with relatively moderate growth in petrol 
and diesel consumption during FY24 and FY25.

2.12	At the same time, the moderate buoyancy of 0.4 in customs duty collections 
during the post-pandemic period reflects calibrated reductions in basic customs duties 
on raw materials and essential goods aimed at supporting domestic manufacturing and 
containing input costs. This trend was further reinforced by softer global commodity 
prices, including crude oil, as taxes levied on an ad valorem basis move in line with 
prices.
2.13	During the current fiscal year, both excise duty and custom duty collections have 
reached about 60 per cent of their respective Budget estimates as of the end of November 
2025, as against 55 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, during the corresponding 
period of the previous year. While the excise duty collections witnessed a growth of 9.3 
per cent, the customs collections have reduced by 7.3 per cent on a YoY basis.
Goods and Services Tax: Revenue stability amid ongoing reform
2.14	The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has played a stabilising role by strengthening 
Government revenues, deepening formalisation, and reinforcing the Government’s 
reform intent. Gross GST revenue during April-December 2025 stood at ₹17.4 lakh 
crore, recording a YoY growth of 6.7 per cent (Chart II.3). The GST revenue growth has 
broadly aligned with the prevailing nominal GDP growth conditions, thus influenced 
in part by lower inflation (Chart II.4a). As a result, while growth rates appear lower in 
percentage terms, collections in absolute terms have recorded multiple all-time highs 
during the current fiscal year.

high-frequency indicators suggest robust transaction volumes, with cumulative e-way

2.16	Looking ahead, the recent rationalisation of GST rates is expected to support 
demand by lowering tax incidence and improving price competitiveness. Since the 
lower rates are expected to stimulate higher consumption volumes and strengthen 
compliance, volume effects could offset the impact of rate reductions on revenues. 
Accordingly, GST collections are expected to remain resilient in the coming quarters. 
The expected channels of impact of these measures are discussed in Box II.2.
Box II.2: Expected channels of impact of GST 2.0 reforms
The 56th meeting of the GST Council has brought in a two-rate structure with a Standard 
Rate of 18 per cent, a Merit Rate of 5 per cent and a special de-merit rate or sin-good rate 
of 40 per cent for a select few goods and services (but inclusive of earlier compensation 
cess rate, and hence with no increase in overall tax burden). The rationalisation of GST 
with effect from 22.09.2025 came as the third leg of the tripod of tax reforms, following the 
corporate tax reductions of 2019 and personal income tax reforms w.e.f. April 2025.

The reduction in the tax burden on essential goods, services, and emerging sectors is expected 
to lower the cost of living, improve affordability, and stimulate household consumption 
demand. At the same time, the move towards a simplified two-rate structure is expected 
to reduce transaction costs, ease compliance, and encourage small businesses to enter the 
formal sector, thereby supporting greater formalisation and widening of the tax base.
Through targeted rate reductions across key sectors, the reform is expected to enhance 
trade competitiveness and support domestic manufacturing. Lowering the GST on cement 
and construction materials is expected to reduce project costs and support real estate 
and infrastructure activities. The reduction in GST on small cars, two-wheelers, and auto 
parts is expected to boost demand and strengthen India’s automotive manufacturing base. 
Reducing GST to zero per cent on select life-saving drugs and 5 per cent on medical devices 
is likely to improve healthcare access while encouraging domestic production. Similarly, 
the shift to a 5 per cent GST rate on toys, handicrafts, and man-made fibres is expected 
to support labour-intensive MSMEs and expand export potential, collectively reinforcing 
growth and investment momentum under the reformed GST regime. Beyond growth and 
formalisation, reduction of GST on solar, wind and related renewable devises from 12 per 
cent to 5 per cent, in addition to lowering GST on biodegradable bags from 18 per cent to 
5 per cent is a major push towards advancing India’s climate goals by making renewable 
energy, waste management, biodegradable products, and green mobility more affordable 
and within reach. 
Aligned with the Viksit Bharat 2047 vision, GST 2.0 also strengthens India’s position as a 
global manufacturing and investment destination. The inverted duty structure (IDS) under

GST, where tax rates on inputs exceed those on outputs, can be structurally eliminated by 
taxing inputs and intermediate goods at lower rates and placing items of final consumption 
at relatively higher rates. Keeping in view the need for a calibrated reform approach, next-
generation GST reforms have already corrected inverted duty in key labour-intensive and 
agri-input sectors such as textiles and fertilisers, thereby reducing cost and working capital 
pressures in these sectors. Further, items rationalised from 12 per cent to 5 per cent or 
to the nil rate largely pertain to goods of mass and daily consumption. Any residual IDS 
issues arising from such rationalisation are being addressed through faster, fully automated 
refunds of unutilised Input Tax Credit (ITC), thereby alleviating working capital stress. 
Going forward, policy options such as permitting IDS refunds on capital goods and input 
services may be examined to preserve tax neutrality without significant revenue erosion.
Recent trends in high-frequency indicators, including higher e-way bill generation, improved 
Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) readings for manufacturing and services, record festive-
season automobile sales, robust UPI transactions, and increased tractor sales, indicate a 
strengthening economic momentum during September-December 2025, following the 
implementation of GST reforms.
2.17	 With the introduction of GST in 2017, the abolition of physical check-posts across 
States marked a major structural reform, significantly improving the free movement 
of goods and reducing transit delays. The e-Way Bill system emerged as an effective 
digital substitute, enabling online tracking of goods movement while supporting tax 
administration objectives without reintroducing physical barriers at the State borders. 
Technology has evolved over time, as have the needs of modern business and logistics. 
Mobile-based checks of e-Way Bills at interior points may, at times, lead to avoidable 
disruptions in logistics and compliance friction for bona fide trade.
2.18	The next wave of GST reforms could, therefore, focus on reimagining the e-Way 
Bill system as a facilitator of smooth logistics rather than only as a tool for enforcement 
and control, in line with the changing needs of businesses and supply chains. As in 
the case of NUDGE (Box II.1), policy design could increasingly rely on trust-based 
and technology-driven compliance models, such as a “trusted dealer” framework, 
under which taxpayers with a strong compliance record face minimal physical checks 
and enjoy greater certainty in the movement of goods. At the same time, wider use 
of e-seals and electronic locking systems, integrated with e-Way Bills and vehicle-
tracking technologies, can ensure secure, end-to-end tracking of consignments without 
routine stoppages on the road. State Governments, which play a key role in field-level 
enforcement, would be central to this transition by shifting towards risk-based, system-
generated alerts and limiting discretionary checks. Together, these reforms would 
amount to a significant deregulation of the logistics ecosystem, reducing costs and delays 
for trade while maintaining effective, non-intrusive oversight for tax administration.

Non-tax revenues buoyed by rising dividends and profits
2.19	The non-tax revenues of the Centre, as a percentage of GDP, have broadly remained 
stable at around 1.4 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic period, in line with the pre-
pandemic average, thereby providing steady support to the Centre’s revenue receipts. 
This stability has been underpinned largely by a surge in dividends and profits, which grew 
by over 70 per cent annually during the last two years (Table II.2). The increase reflects 
higher surplus transfers from the RBI, along with improved financial performance of 
public sector banks and financial institutions. During FY26, RBI approved a surplus 
transfer of ₹2.68 lakh crore to the Central Government for the accounting year FY25, 
which is about 27 per cent higher than the dividend of ₹2.19 lakh crore paid in the 
previous year. As a result, during April to November 2025, non-tax revenues registered 
a growth of 20.9 per cent, reaching 88.6 per cent of the Budget Estimates for the year. 
Among “other” components of non-tax revenue, economic services accounted for a 
significant share, with major contributions from communication, roads and bridges.

2.20	The improved performance of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) has 
also contributed to the growth in the Centre’s non-tax revenues. Between FY20 and 
FY25, the gross turnover per CPSE increased by approximately 32 per cent, while net 
profits and dividends per CPSE went up by 174 per cent and 69 per cent respectively 
(Table II.3), reflecting operational efficiency and effective capital management of 
PSUs. This has also helped to protect the interests of minority stakeholders in CPSEs.

Non-debt capital receipts
2.21	Receipts from asset and equity monetisation are an important component of the 
Government’s non-debt capital receipts. During FY26 (up to 31 December 2025), the 
disinvestment activity remained focused on market-based transactions aligned with 
valuation discipline and minimum public shareholding norms. Three OFS transactions 
were undertaken – in Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited, Bank of Maharashtra and 
Indian Overseas Bank. These OFS transactions together mobilised around ₹7,717.02 
crore. In addition, remittances from SUUTI12 totalled approximately ₹1,051 crore 
during the year. InvIT-based monetisation yielded ₹18,837 crore. 
2.22	Strategic disinvestment has progressed in a calibrated manner over recent years. 
Since 2016, in-principle approval has been accorded for strategic disinvestment for 36 
CPSEs, of which 13 transactions have been completed, with the remainder at various 
stages of implementation. During FY26, approvals were also accorded for stake dilution 
or exit from select joint ventures, including NTPC’s divestment from Utility Powertech 
Limited. These actions were complemented by governance reforms that empowered 
CPSE Boards to undertake the closure, merger, or disinvestment of subsidiaries. 
2.23	Going forward, receipts from equity monetisation can be strengthened by 
selectively reducing Government equity in certain CPSEs beyond the minimum public 
shareholding norms13, guided by market conditions and enterprise-specific factors. 
Currently, in about 30 per cent of listed CPSEs, Government shareholding is already 
below 60 per cent, limiting further disinvestment through OFS, as it is stipulated in 
the Companies Act that a ‘government company’ must have at least 51 per cent of its 
stake held by the central or state government. Since effective control requires only 
about a 26 per cent stake, the Government could consider amending the definition of 
“Government Company” under the Companies Act, limited to listed entities, to allow 
them to remain as government companies with a minimum of 26 per cent ownership, 
thereby retaining special resolution rights, while enabling the government to monetise 
its stake. Alternatively, if the objective is eventual privatisation, the Government could 
continue phased OFS below 51 per cent and even towards full exit, without changing 
the legal definition of “government company”. This would enable CPSEs to function 
post-disinvestment as professionally managed entities with dispersed ownership, 
clear governance standards, and transparent succession frameworks. A portion of 
disinvestment receipts could also be earmarked for strategic investments in emerging 
technology and innovation-driven companies through professionally managed 
platforms such as the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), thereby

recycling public capital toward future growth sectors. This will also ensure a steady 
stream of disinvestment receipts into the future.14
Trends in expenditure
Continued rationalisation in revenue expenditure
2.24	As fiscal deficits consolidated in the aftermath of successive economic shocks, 
a significant part of the adjustment has been achieved through the rationalisation of 
revenue expenditure. The revenue expenditure has moderated from 13.6 per cent of 
GDP in FY22 to 10.9 per cent in FY25, which is lower than the pre-pandemic average of 
11.1 per cent of GDP, thereby creating space for more productive capital expenditure.
2.25	A large share of revenue expenditure, covering salaries, pensions, interest payments, 
and defence, is committed in nature, highlighting the importance of rationalising 
discretionary spending, particularly subsidies, to create fiscal space. Expenditure on 
major subsidies (See Table II.4), which rose during the pandemic, declined from 1.9 per 
cent of GDP in FY22 to 1.2 per cent in FY25 and is budgeted at 1.1 per cent of GDP in 
FY26. This consolidation has been achieved alongside a continued commitment to food 
security, with about 78.9 crore beneficiaries receiving free food grains as of October 
2025.15

2.26 In addition to streamlining the design of subsidy schemes, efficiency gains from 
the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) framework have played a key role in reducing subsidy 
outlays by curbing fiscal leakages, estimated at ₹3.48 lakh crore over the past decade.16 
These gains have been made possible by improved targeting, even as beneficiary coverage 
expanded nearly sixteen-fold from about 11 crore to 176 crore over the past decade. The 
efficiency gains are evident across major schemes, including PDS, MGNREGA17, PM-
KISAN and fertiliser subsidies.18 An issue that remains to be addressed is cross-subsidy 
in the railway traffic and power sectors (See Box II.3). 
Box II.3: Cross Subsidies in railway traffic and power distribution
For FY23, freight earnings accounted for about 68 per cent of the gross traffic receipts of 
Railways, largely reliant on coal transportation. The profit from freight traffic was utilised to 
offset the loss on passenger and other services, leaving an uncovered loss of ₹5257 crore from 
passenger operations19. CAG20 has recommended critically analysing the cost of passenger 
operations, taking steps to reduce its losses, and diversifying its freight basket to enhance 
freight earnings. During the last 5 years, the passenger fare has been rationalised on three 
occasions i.e., on 1 January 2020, 1 July 2025 and 26 December 2025, and consequently, the 
share of freight earnings in gross traffic receipts has declined gradually from 68 per cent in 
FY 23 to 65 per cent in FY25 and is budgeted to be 62 per cent in FY26. 
High freight rates, due to cross-subsidisation, distort competition with roads, inflating 
commodity and consumer prices, as well as logistics costs. Rationalising freight rates could 
improve revenue buoyancy, incentivise a modal shift of freight from roads to rail, and 
increase market share. This, in turn, would stimulate economic activity, green the transport 
sector, and decongest road space.
In India's power sector, cross-subsidisation primarily involves charging higher tariffs to 
industrial and commercial consumers (subsidising categories) to offset lower tariffs for 
domestic and agricultural users (subsidised categories). This is structured through category-
wise subsidies, where the average billing rate (ABR) for the former category exceeds the average 
cost of supply (ACoS), while the latter pays below ACoS. The Electricity Act, 2003, requires 
SERCs to progressively reduce cross subsidies in 10 tariffs so as to ensure that they reflect the 
cost of supply.21 However, in some states, for certain categories, ACoS coverage exceeds the ±20 
per cent limit specified in the Tariff Policy.22

Accordingly, the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2025, was introduced to address deep-
rooted inefficiencies, alleviate financial strain on the power sector, promote competition, 
and optimise network costs across India’s power distribution sector. It aims to transform 
the existing market structure by rationalising cross-subsidies, promoting cost-reflective 
tariffs, and enabling direct power procurement by industrial users. It mandates that the 
tariff must reflect the cost of supplying electricity.  It also requires that cross-subsidies 
paid by manufacturing enterprises, railways, and metro railways must be fully eliminated 
within five years.23 Going forward, a balanced approach could include rationalising tariffs 
for subsidised categories by introducing phased rates and quotas, as well as voluntary and 
category- based exclusions.
2.27	Interest payments, another major component of the Centre’s revenue expenditure, 
increased from an average of about 3.1 per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic years to 
around 3.4 per cent of GDP in the post-pandemic period, reflecting higher borrowing 
undertaken to support economic recovery during the pandemic. Interest payments 
account for approximately 36.8 per cent of the net revenue receipts to the Centre24 in 
FY25(PA). Going forward, interest costs are expected to be contained through active 
debt management measures being undertaken by the Government, such as switch 
and buyback operations, and calibrated issuance across the yield curve. In parallel, 
sustained direct and indirect tax reforms are expected to strengthen revenue flows in 
the medium term, thereby directly reducing incremental borrowing requirements and, 
in turn, the interest burden as fiscal consolidation progresses. 
2.28	The government could also adopt measures to enhance the efficiency of its 
collections by making them real-time (such as requiring banks to remit TDS on a real-
time basis instead of in batches) and, if necessary, engage a treasury manager to invest 
its short-term surpluses in liquid instruments, thereby earning more return on its 
cash balances. The Government has already undertaken significant process reforms to 
improve the efficiency, timing, and transparency of fund releases, and while incurring 
expenditures, details of some of which are outlined in Box II.4 below.
Box II.4: Tech-driven solutions for improving efficiency in  
public expenditures
Just-in-Time (JIT) Fund Release Reforms 
The Central Government has undertaken a major public financial management reform by 
shifting to a Just-in-Time (JIT) fund release system to improve cash management, reduce 
idle balances, enhance transparency, and strengthen expenditure efficiency. This reform

replaces the earlier credit-push model of bulk fund releases with a debit-pull model, under 
which funds are released only when expenditure is incurred. JIT has been implemented 
through two key initiatives:
SNA-SPARSH (Single Nodal Account-Samyochit Pranali Ekikrit Shighra Hastantaran) for 
Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and the Treasury Single Account (TSA) and TSA Hybrid 
models for Central Sector (CS) schemes.
The reform was necessitated by large idle balances parked with implementing agencies, 
averaging about ₹1.6 lakh crore under CSS, leading to inefficiencies, fund diversion risks, 
and high opportunity costs (particularly when government borrowing rates are around 7 per 
cent per annum). Launched in 2023, SNA-SPARSH enables JIT release of the Central share of 
CSS directly from RBI accounts against actual expenditure based on prior mother sanctions 
issued, thereby eliminating bulk transfers and preventing fund diversion. Integrated with 
Public Financial Management System (PFMS), State FMIS, and RBl's e-Kuber, it now 
covers all 28 States, 3 UTs, and 73 CSS including umbrella schemes (as of 15.01.2026). SNA 
balances declined sharply from ₹1.67 lakh crore in April 2024 to ₹1.22 lakh crore in April 
2025 and to about ₹0.4 lakh crore as on 15.01.2026, generating significant interest savings 
and reducing reliance on short-term borrowings.
For Central Sector schemes, TSA extends JIT principles by eliminating advance transfers to 
implementing agencies, with funds drawn directly from RBI accounts through assignment 
limits. From FY25, all CS schemes with outlays of ₹100 crore or more are covered. The 
TSA Hybrid model addresses schemes involving private or lower-tier agencies by ensuring 
immediate, JIT transfers for payments. As on 15.01.2026 for FY26, 157 schemes are covered 
under TSA CS, with assignments of ₹3.09 lakh crores issued and ₹2.45 lakh crores of 
expenditure incurred. For TSA OCE (other central expenditure), the number of schemes 
covered stands at 93, with assignments of ₹0.9 lakh crore issued and ₹0.79 lakh crores of 
expenditure incurred, alongside substantial savings in interest costs.
Tech-driven solutions in the Public Distribution System (PDS) supply chain
Route Optimisation in the Public Distribution System (RO-PDS) in India is a strategic initiative 
to improve efficiency and reduce costs by using optimisation algorithms developed by IIT-
Delhi and the UN World Food Programme. These algorithms define optimal warehouse-to-
warehouse and warehouse-to-Fair Price Shop (FPS) routes, lowering transportation costs, 
saving time, and ensuring timely delivery of food grains through operations research.
Within a year, route optimisation assessments were completed across 31 States/Union 
Territories (UTs), with estimated annual transportation savings of about ₹250 crore. 
Interstate optimisation for moving food grains from surplus to deficit states was also 
achieved by integrating the Freight Operating Information System (FOIS) of Centre for 
Railway Information Systems (CRIS) with the indigenous PM Gati Shakti Master Plan 
Platform for distance optimisation.
The initiative delivers both economic and environmental benefits. Since food miles contribute 
nearly one-fifth of global food system emissions, optimising PDS routes helps reduce fuel

use and CO₂ emissions, supporting India’s Paris Agreement and COP commitments, 
conserving foreign exchange, and promoting a climate-smart food supply chain. States 
reduced average transport distances by up to 50 per cent and CO₂ emissions by up to 35 per 
cent.
Building on these results, optimisation plans for the Kharif Marketing Season 2025–26 
have been developed for 10 paddy-procuring states. RO-PDS also seeks to minimise human 
intervention that increases costs and pilferage. State governments have been provided the 
Anna Chakra Optimisation Tools, while FCI has received the Rake Optimisation Tool to 
automate and optimise grain supply chain decisions nationwide, aligned with the PM Gati 
Shakti initiative.
Capital expenditure
2.29	The Centre has progressively scaled up capital expenditure from an average of 1.7 
per cent of GDP in the pre-pandemic period to an average of 2.9 per cent of GDP in 
the years after the pandemic (Chart II.5). At the same time, effective capex, a broader 
measure which includes capital expenditure along with grants-in-aid for the creation 
of capital assets, increased from an average of 2.7 per cent of GDP to 3.9 per cent of 
GDP over the same period, and further to 4 percent in FY25 (PA). These grants-in-
aid have supported asset creation in key areas, including urban and housing affairs, 
the Jal Jeevan Mission, and rural development. The sustained expansion of the capital 
component, achieved alongside declining revenue and fiscal deficits, reflects a deliberate 
rebalancing of expenditure towards asset-creating outlays (Chart II.6).

2.30	Emphasis on asset creation is also reflected in the composition of capital expenditure 
across key infrastructure sectors. Road transport and highways, along with railways, 
continued to account for over half of total capital expenditure through FY25(PA). At the 
same time, allocations towards transfers to States, telecommunications, and housing 
and urban affairs recorded robust double-digit growth, leading to a higher share for 
these sectors in overall capex.

Trends in expenditure in FY26
2.31	During the current fiscal year, capex recorded a strong rebound, rising by 28 per 
cent YoY as of the end of November 2025 (Chart II.7). This amounted to nearly 59 per 
cent of the budgeted allocation for capex, which was in line with the trends in FY24 
(FY25 had a lower expenditure rate in the first half as it was an election year). On 
the other hand, revenue expenditure grew by only 1.8 per cent during the first eight 
months of the year, reflecting a continued commitment to fiscal con
